  I order a size medium fit perfect !!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  VERY stretchy. I definitely could have down sized. I ordered xl. I‚Äôm size 16 around 200lbs. I have about a c chest. If you have a smaller chest or a saggy chest size down. Very comfy. I would highly recommend this

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I used the measurements from the last picture, and it fits perfectly! He's gonna love it!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I really love the color of this babydoll lingerie! Slipping into this was super comfortable, and the material doesn't make you itch. I can sleep very comfortable with this, and this also is very flattering if you want to impress someone. This is definitely something to have in your collection.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits perfect! Love the adjustable straps since my shoulders are tiny. Beautiful color and soft material.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Sexy! Gorgeous color.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  He is going to love it! I love the color and the material is so unbelievably soft!!!üòã It makes me feel very beautiful! 10/10 would recommend.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs amazing!! Comfortable the clasp is easy to undo I love it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 198LBS, ordered an XL but I could have gone with an Large. Otherwise I love it, fabric is soft and doesn‚Äôt tug at my nipple piercings. I love it and my husband loves it. Definitely recommend.No support but if you‚Äôre comfortable with yourself it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So so so beautiful.  For the price this really can't be beat. Super sexy, feels super comfortable. Definitely a worth whole purchase. I would reccomend this to ANYONE. if you have large breasts I would highly recommend ordering a size up. I have a small chest in comparison to my size, and it JUST fit me right. But if my chest were any larger they would be busting out.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  First time buying something like this online and I'm.so happy I took the chance because it's beautiful!I'm 36DD, size large and it fits perfectly....True to size, sexy, comfortable and even if it does not offer any support to your breast it's still very complimenting.Definitely a good buy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered size 3X just because I didn‚Äôt know how small or how the fit would be. I am bigger chested so I got it that size. It fits a bit loose on me but still very comfortable. The texture is very smooth. The underwear I found it poorly made. Too small at the front and the gstring too big lol üòÜ can‚Äôt complain about this as it is very good decent price and also adorable. Though it was a bit too loose on me, it fits perfect n my top area.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This product was tricky for me. Some parts were too big and some too small. The breast cups are too small if you are larger chested. The bra also doesn't offer any support. It flows nicely, but the material isn't the greatest. However, for the price it will do just fine! I just wish it fit better, I followed the size guide perfectly.

  Item arrived and upon opening the package, wife said it smelled mildewy. She washed item and it still smelled. She then threw the item out. Seeing as it took over a month to get, it didn't seem worth returning. Cost wise wouldn't have made sense either.

  wife says it fits great

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this wig . It's so cute on & exactly what I wanted.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This item runs big and the quality was not very good.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I really like this little outfit.It is actually a bit bigger than I expected, I got a medium and probably could have gotten a small5'2"" 145 lbs

  This runs 2 sizes to big, fits like a tent.

  Superrr sexy! üòçSo hey fellow reader, Me & my husband have a VERY active (& healthy) sexlife. We like to keep things spicy in the bedroom so we‚Äôll use toys or do some deep role playing every few months. This particular time, I wanted to be a sexy college professor (I know, corny af but carry on) soo I ordered this set in purple. I also purchased a long dark wig on and some fake glasses off Amazon too. I even pulled out some of my old college books ü§£ü§£ I went alllll out. Soo I got dressed & did my makeup.. the wholeee time I was trying to figure out my lines I was going to say! Cause I want to stay in character and be sexy.. & not look crazy..don‚Äôt want to kill the mood, of course. Mind you, ALL of this is going on while he‚Äôs just in the next room so I‚Äôm trying to hurry up so he doesn‚Äôt walk in and kill the surprise. Thankfully, he didn‚Äôt! So when I was ready I called him to the room and when he walked in.. his jaw DROPPED! I had on a matching thong & bra set underneath the costume  with a garter belt & stockings/fishnets! Listennnn üî• he was NOT ready for all this! He instantly caught on and started playing along and a few minutes after some role playing.. well, you know üôÉ it went downnn, like the volume when the police gets behind your car. Long story short ladies, BUY IT! Plan out a sexy night for you and your partner. It‚Äôll be a night you‚Äôll never forget! Okay I‚Äôm gone ‚úåüèº

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'5, 235 pounds, size 42 DDD/FLet's just say I wanted to buy all the colors but settled with just getting one in purple as well just now.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Perfect in every single  way ( ordered small)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bought this for my girlfriend.  Fit perfect.  Looks great.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  On poinnnnttt I love it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Okay so let me begin by saying this product went beyod my expectations. I was expecting something not, and not only did I recieve that but its also very well made. The quality of the skirt is thick and the top adjust nicely in all the right places. I'm 5'2, 168lbs ( damn Rona made me gain a few lbs.) And I'm a size 36DD. For the most part I'm very self concious, but this made me feel so sexy. I can't wait to get pretty and dress up for my man! He's gonna love this.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This was way better quality than I expected and looked so good. The band on the skirt is pretty relaxed so definitely make sure you're ordering your size. I'm 5'3 145 lbs and a C-cup  and I ordered a Large and it's seriously perfect.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I personally loved it, the bottoms made me kinda want a larger size only because I wish it was a little longer but its still super cute and fits perfectly.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very sexy outfit. True to size. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and 200 pounds. I‚Äôm muscular and in shape. So I purchased a large and it fits perfectly.  Looks good with white stocking and a pair of black  heels.  Thanks Amazon :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  For that little money you can get a lot of fun out of it, first time my sexy wife wear it for me, we needed no fourplay just go for it and my wife had actually fun to wear it for me,

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The quality is very nice. I love that the skirt has an elastic. My husband loved it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  We appreciated the quality,  and the fit was good as long ad we ordered 2 sizes bigger then usual

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The shoulders are strange. May not be good for someone with larger breasts as the seam for the shoulder is at the top of my breast

  Hot stuff wife looks awesome in it. Downside is it caused our bed to break .üòú

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Satisfied

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is like buying a sock, well it looks like the size of a sock anyways. It is very strechy and will work for someone who is a bit heavy I'm 5'1 and 180lbs 38DD.I don't like his outfit myself or the way it feels at all,but my husband does like it. When going to take it off it will roll up like panty hose does

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Im defiantly a plus size short womanFits great didnt dig into my skin but being short and not wanting it to be longer than right at my butt i had to fold the top over which was fine. My husband went crazy the material is soft it doesnt dig i think next time ill try some double sided tape to keep it from rolling up üòÇ but thats a given! Super cute i felt very sexy

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  One size fits all. It works for sizes 16 and under. After that it just doesn‚Äôt look sexy anymore üò©

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought this for my wife after buying something similar that she and I both love.  I thought the holes would be a little bit smaller, not that it matters much.  The point of this is to cling to the body and accentuate the curves, which it does quite nicely!  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because in my head it isn‚Äôt as sexy as the other one I referenced, but it‚Äôs still a nice addition to the collection and would highly recommend it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  In typical cheap China fashion, picture in Green description is Black in two places, I want black but I get green. Uh, why does Amazon have so much cheap knock off crap?

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super hot!

  LOVE! Smooths out tummy great as well as hiding it and flatters curves so well! i will for sure order another one it is so sexy and soft and very stretchy! if you are thinking about buying it trust me its worth it! im 230 lbs 5‚Äô5 but my stomach is small for my size

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I loved it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love it. As a girl with a belly I was kind of nervous about if I'd look like a busted can of biscuits in this boy was I wrong!! Looks an feels great I will say with if you wear a Womens 14 I would go with an XL just because YES it does strech buttttt not a lot. I myself am I between an 12 an 14 depending on the brand an I got a L but XL mite have been just a little better but the L still looked great! If anything the L helped ""the girls"" perk up. An that's another thing I'm a 38 DDD/F and it worked perfect the V pattern an the halter string help the perk up. Hope this helps

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 205lbs and this stretches to fit my curves and my thick figure. I like it a lot. At first It looks small but, ‚Äúgirls it will fit just about anyone‚Äù.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Sexy lingerie even for plus size ladies. I'm a 20-22 and bought the 22 it's a little snug getting it on but very cute. Will buy other colors

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was a lil worried pulling it.out of the pkg it looked way to small ...but after putting it on DAMN I was feeling it. I didn't look like a busted can of biscuits...I was looking GOOD!!!!!! I did go up a size I'm normally and XL and I got a XXL!!!! Big girls BUY this you won't be disappointed I promise!!!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Looks just like the picture and good quality. Did not tear when I put it on. I just don‚Äôt have the figure for it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Loved it . So did my honey bun ;)The halter part is a bit funny fitting but still nice

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Doesn‚Äôt worth the money

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great

  Edit, two years later!This lingerie is still fantastic! It's lasted well, without any of the lace falling apart or becoming scratchy. It's stood the test of several costumes, as well as getting rave reviews in my love life. I bought another color about a year ago (red), which was a great vibrant color, exactly as pictured, and felt and fit the same as the first one. I may just buy another color this year!2019 review:Oh my god. This is great. I'm 5'1"" and about 275lbs, which I carry around my lower belly, butt, and thighs. I purchased the 4X. This item is amazing. It fit perfectly. Some things to note in particular:- It's not scratchy. It's very comfortable. Sometimes lace and fishnet material gets scratchy, but this is not just comfortable but borders on soft.- The crotch snaps are barely noticeable. You know they're there, because you saw them or used them to put it on, but you can't feel them when the item is actually on.- The straps are adjustable. This really helped me because I was able to adjust the straps so the top of the teddy actually held my boobs in place (I wear a 42DD).I'm just honestly really overwhelmed. I ordered this item to use for Halloween, and I had my doubts. It didn't have very many reviews, but it was a low price, so I went for it. It came within two days (Prime), fit exactly like I wanted it to, and, the cherry on top, it was a low price. I highly recommend this. Plus size girls gotta stick together, so I made sure to write this review right after trying it on.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm very happily surprised at how nice this is for the price! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù currently 140 Lbs & 34D. I‚Äôve gained 10-15 lbs recently and carry that weight in my belly and chest so I wanted something to cover that.  I have a short torso and this fits great lengthwise so I‚Äôm not sure if it would be great for someone that‚Äôs taller, but there are adjustable straps to give a little extra room. There is no support in the bust, but with the way it‚Äôs low cut, it still looks great. Also, fits awesome on the butt. It cuts high up and doesn‚Äôt leave anything to the imagination in the back, but with the front covered, that‚Äôs a plus. I‚Äôm surprised at how soft it is too!Only con is that it smells like chemicals. I hand washed it in the sink and it bled badly. I‚Äôd suggest only handwashing for this reason.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 190lbs and I got this in a XL. I LOVEEE this! I felt very confident and sexy when I tried it on and my boyfriend liked it too!! I wanna wear this everyday

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'9 165lbs. 40,35,43 measurements. I ordered the Xl and the fit is amazing. The quality is suprising for the cost. The lace is soft and silky, not itchy like some other lace lingerie I have purchased. The button closures are quality. The color is exactly as advertised. Excellent quality and find for a cheap price!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Loved this body suit! It fit like a glove great quality!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I absolutely love this outfit. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 145 lbs with 36 DDDs at my age I‚Äôm super proud of them üòù. I got a large and it fit good. Little loose on the rear cause all my goods are up top (unfortunately). I paired this with a black mini shirt and strapped heels for a night out.  I threw over a white button up just in case people said anything.  I‚Äôve never felt sexier.  My husband was happy.  Win win

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'3 and 150lbs. Womens size 6/8. I am hippy. The medium is way too tight down below, but I bought this as lingerie so, it serves its purpose. I could never wear it out in day light with an outfit. The V comes way further down below than the photos portray. But I do realize that I may need a large. But again, its fine for me. I would say order a size up. The material and quality is as expected. Thank u!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Really happy with this item! I am 5'6"" and a 42D cup and a size 20 in pants, I wear a 1 or 2 in stores like Torrid for panties, I carry all my weight in my tummy due to diastasis recti. I wish this had just a liiiiiiittle more chest support, but the cleavage angle is flattering anyway. The lace is a nice thickness and I like the strategic panels that offer peekaboo but not totally sheer. I ordered a 4X and I don't think changing size would make a difference; it fit just right in terms of tightness, not uncomfortable but not too loose either. I may buy it in more colors! It came in a frosted plastic zip-top bag.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great quality and fast delivery ! Fits perfect to my size !!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  survived in the drier but should air dry, dress to success in the bedroom ;)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits perfect!!!

  I am 5‚Äô4 and 140 pounds. I got size M. Perfect!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The back part fell apart, but i super glued it and was still able to use it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The fabric was lovely and the outfit looked great but was slightly too big in the chest area. I didn‚Äôt want to return it despite being too big.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bought this for my girlfriend for Valentine‚Äôs Day. I tried it and it was a little small (as to be expected because I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4‚Äù), but I will say it was comfortable and looked amazing. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll look better on her though.......

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The underwear broke after not even 20 min of me trying it on for the first time.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Felt very cheap and poorly made. TERRIBLE fit! The only reason I didn‚Äôt return it was because I missed the deadline. I literally THREW IT AWAY with the tags still on it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I purchased this and wore it for the first time today. Not only was the fit perfect, but it was also extremely comfortable! Both the mesh and lace fabrics are very soft and stretchy, especially amazing for such a reasonable price! This piece is a perfect balance of sexy, but yet also covers problem areas. It is super flattering! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and very curvy- I‚Äôm about 220lbs. I usually wear a 12 in jeans and a 36DD in bras (L-XL for shirts, depending on the style). The XL in black that I purchased was great and I probably could have even gone down to the L if I wanted to because of the stretch in the fabrics. I really love that the straps are fully adjustable because I always have to adjust them all the way as tight as they go- this piece was no exception. The panties fit well. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the elastic strap at the crotch area, but that‚Äôs really the only thing I didn‚Äôt love about this. It was a great buy and I definitely recommend it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I Love This!!! I Decided To Buy This For This Upcoming Valentines Day As A Surprise For My BF! I've Never Bought Lingerie Online So I Was Very Hesitant But This Turned Out To Be A Good Buy!!! It Fits Very Well. BTW I'm 270lbs and I'm 5'7"" & I Wear A 22 In Jeans With A Somewhat Small Bust Size So If You Got Big Boobies Then I Would Suggest A Matching Bra But Besides That Its A Good One.... PS... I Bought A 3x

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I used this for a photoshoot and absolutely loved it! Great fit, beautiful color!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Absolutely loved this!!! I am a size 10/12, 5'5"" and 170 pounds and I got a size large and it was perfect!!! I got this for a boudior shoot and it was absolutely perfect and the photographer loved it also!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love it I bought a xxl I weight 180 lbs & I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù bra size 36DDD

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  First off, this thing is soooo soft. Huge plus for me. Very comfy to move around in, and its as pretty in person as the product image. I want another one in a different color. Its a tiny bit ""short"" so it rides up a bit (im 5ft even) but thats my only downside.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this SO much! Everything about it is perfect. I thought the waist band tie would be a cheap silk material but its actually a decent somewhat stretchy material! The lace is great quality, soft and delicate, not itchy or hard, and the straps are thankfully adjustable. I followed the advice of other reviews and got a size up and I'm glad I did. I tried it on and realized I would have been alright in my usual small, but I knew I would be more comfortable in a medium.Overall great product!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is amazing and the price is even better! My only issue is that it rides up my crotch a little but I have a long torso so that's normal! üòÇ It came with stockings but the ones I am wearing, I bought separately! Fits like a glove!! I'm 5'2 120 lbs and I got a medium! Highly recommend!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  As a reference, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, 34D, waist: 30‚Äù, hips: 37‚Äù, shoulder to crotch: about 27‚Äù. I ordered a medium.This is a beautiful piece of lingerie! It doesn‚Äôt look cheaply made at all. The material isn‚Äôt itchy at all.It stretches and has some give to it- perfect for hugging your curves. It does ride up my coochie a bit but only after moving around a lot. Covers the perfect amount of my breasts.I will definitely be ordering in other colors.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I buy inexpensive lingerie from Amazon because I expect to only wear it in the bedroom and that it might get torn during amorous activities ;).  The quality obviously isn't terrific and it certainly doesn't give any support to the girls, but I was comfortable in it and my boyfriend enjoyed it.  I'm 5'10"", 180 lbs, 36DDD and ordered an XL, but probably could have gotten away with a large.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fue una excelente compra, dud√© un poco de la calidad, pero ya que me lleg√≥ qued√© encantada üòç

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Unfortunately I did not receive this item before valentine but it fits pretty good and hubby loved it on me. The only thing I find wrong was the bra. Not supportive at all and I'm 32c,I got a large in size.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered a size up but this is beautiful and fits well!! Loving it a lot. My partner was very very happy when I wore it. It looks nice on and could be worn as a shirt

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  When it came, the ribbon immediately broke the first time I tried to tie it. Pretty disappointing, because it looks super cute.

  I love this gown, it is so comfortable! The straps are elastic and adjustable, the move easily when you move. I don't get tangled in this when I sleep and it helps keep me cool. Plus, it provides enough coverage to wear around the house, but still feels sexy and attractive. This was fron our honeymoon!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I can‚Äôt believe how inexpensive this is...it really is super nice. I could see this compared with a nightgown in Neiman Marcus! I am a size M/L and 5‚Äô7 and I ordered a Large

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very nice feel to the fabric, I washed it prior to wear, it did not shrink, it is rather stretchy and so are the straps. It is rather short in the back (as I wanted) but is still appropriate in the front. Boyfriend is more than willing to get me some different colors heheFYI, i ordered a mediumI am a size 8 in pants, 6 in dress, 34DD-32DDD Bust, 30‚Äù waist, 38‚Äù hips

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The night gown is comfortable and fits well, why the 3 stars, well we use white sheets and the dye transfer has ruined sheets. I have washed several times and used every trick I know to remedy this with no success.UPDATE - I am back here getting this in white, the black one is still staining the sheets, but it is so comfortable and my husband really likes it and hates to see me give it up and so we have decided maybe the white would be a good compromise.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This slip is perfect! It‚Äôs so comfy and was true to size for me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù and weigh about 145lbs and I ordered a M which was the perfect size. I was afraid it was gonna be too short cause I was wearing it as a costume but it was the perfect length, I plan to buy more in other colors for sure!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought the royal blue originally and I loved it so much I decided to get the grey as well.  I'm 5'0"" and 90 lbs with a 34B bust, 26"" waist and 32"" hips and it's not easy to find lingerie that looks good.  So many pieces hit at a sexy mid-thigh on the model and I order the very smallest size, but the hemline is below my knees and I look like I'm playing dress-up with my mommy's slips.  This chemise fit beautifully.  It's a few inches above the knee -- not as high as it looks on the model, but I'll take it.  I did notice that one review is from a lady who's 5'3"" and she says it's below her knee, so I guess it also depends on proportion -- I have long legs for my height and a shorter torso.  I also shortened the straps as far as they'd go to keep them from slipping off my shoulders.  It's my one complaint about the chemise, that I wish it were a crossback style or had a connecting strap in the back to keep the straps where they belong, because satin fabric against skin is slippery as hell and those suckers make a dive for it whenever I move.  I'm actually planning to take a scissor to the straps where they connect to the back of the chemise and then resew them so they cross diagonally to make an X in the back. It's a simple 5 minute bit of sewing to preserve my delicate modesty!  Okay, fine, if I had any delicate modesty I wouldn't be wearing tiny satin lingerie, but I still don't like constantly chasing after the straps of my nightgown to make sure nothing's peeking out that shouldn't be (I'm talking about my boobs).  After that little matter is taken care of, this will become my favorite thing to sleep in.  I love the way the fabric drapes and how silky and comfortable it is, and the lace doesn't itch.  It looks beautiful, feels nice, fits well.  I'd have paid a lot more for this if I had to.  I'll probably come back for another few colors.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I can‚Äôt say if it is the size because I bought it for her my daughters  Bridal Brunch. Later I will let you know when she try‚Äôs it on! I showed it to her and she loved it so I bought it without her knowing so it‚Äôs a present and she said that she would wear it on her hooneymoon! So after she tries it on I will come back to tell you about the size! But it arrived on time and was no trouble ordering it for her. Great Seller they do just what they said they would do! A+ seller I would buy from them again and recommend them to anyone!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love, love, love these nightgowns!!! I have them in several colors now!I'm tall & slender and usually wear a size M but to be safe, I checked the sizing info. It resulted me in ordering a M and absolutely love the feel! I could have probably gotten away easily with a size S, but I prefer having a bit more room and nothing snug. That being said, it's not so big that sleeping in it causes a big wrestle match!I am very happy with my beautiful assortment of comfy and yet sexy sleepwear! (My husband loves them too! ;) )

  I am pretty much a true size 4, and there is a review on here that reads the small doesn't fit a 4. Seeing this, I ordered a medium, which is my fault. It's really pretty, just the fit is a little off, but then again I did order a size too big. So, if you are a true size 4, it might be just a tad snug in some areas, maybe not though, but I'm positive a small would've been a much better fit. Good thing the top ties, and there was enough left around the chest that I was able to tie it as well instead of using the hooks. WAY too big under the chest. So, with all that being said, a small might be just a little snug in some areas, but a medium fits a little too awkwardly on a true size 4. Hope this helps any other 4's out there.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'9 and 170. Wear a size 14 dress. 36 D and this fits PERFECTLY.  This is the ONLY company I would buy lingerie from on Amazon.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Absolutely adorable, I love that it is crotchless. Soft material and sexy look from the front and the back!! The top has a single hook bra clip and also ties over the shoulders so it can be adjusted easily. My man says 5 stars too :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is supposed to be the blue green one. This doesn't look anything like the picture! This is closer to the light blue than the blue green. Disappointed.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very cool looking outfit, very excited to have it on my honeymoon! I'm 5'7 and 155lbs, got the large and am happy with how it fits. I could have MAYBE gotten the XL but I fear it would have had too much extra room in it and wouldn't have fit correctly. I think it depends on how much boob you have to fill out the top portion lol as a B cup the piece fit pretty nicely. Worth the price.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5ft 8in and 178 lbs, size 36c chest and have a big booty. I got a large and it fits me perfect. I‚Äôve never felt so confident in lingerie before. Usually these one peice sets are too small on my booty and too big on my chest. This stretches perfectly and fits amazing. It is so sexy!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My girlfriend picked this out so I bought it for her she wore it for about an hour and when she took it off it had dyed the skin underneath a dark purple kinda like barny and took quite some time to fade away also dont purchase if you have a bellybutton piercing it almost ripped hers out the second time around.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The rose color was lighter pink than I expected. The xl is too big with the stomach straps hanging loose but the large is a bit snug and too revealing.  I'd still go with the snug large. My outfit came with the stomach strap twisted and I couldn't fix that so had to send it back. I do want to try the large teal though.

  I have large natural breasts and thought this would only look good on small perky or breasts with implants but I‚Äôm so glad I was wrong. I made the knot and bow under my chest then pulled it over squeezing my girls in. Using just a little bit of water on the skin of the side boob helps keep the ribbon in place. (Like when you‚Äôre freshly toweled off). Pulling off the Ribon was the best part. Get it. Very forgiving

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My boyfriend loved it and I got the results that I wanted. The only thing that bugged me was since the material of the ribbon was slippery, it was easy to fall off my breasts. Please excuse the ribbon. I had no idea was I so terrible at tying them. üòÇI am a 34B.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5‚Äô2 130 lbs  Petite. Ordered a medium a small would have worked also. I am a 34/36 chest. Fits perfectly. Fabric is soft. Stretches in the waist area to fit well.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  If your looking for something sexy for yourself this is definitely it. It fits stunning on you, I have a lower belly and this hides it very well and it genuinely made me look curvier and with a big bum something I wasn‚Äôt expecting. It hides all your insecurities yet it still makes you feel sexy. I highly recommend this outfit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love it !!! Fits perfectlyI ordered size L. It fits my 36ddd and long enough for my torso

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is a seriously sexy pair of lingerie no matter what color you choose! I agree with the other commenters that say the bow doesn't stay on very well. My partner likes to undo the bow right away anyway so I say it isn't too bad of a design flaw. This is worth the money and if washed in lingerie laundry bag it will last a long time!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  looks and fit how i expected i got a larger just to be on the safe size because things run funny when your shopping online . but i loved it ! has adjustable straps if needed and very nice material soft and silky

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Ribbon doesn't stay over breasts. Not as cute in person

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  When my wife opened the package she noticed right away that the garment had a chemical odour. She said it smelled similar to turpentine, it was unbearable. She tried washing it 5 times, once with vinegar without any success. Now our washing machine smells like turpentine which we now have to deal with and she has thrown out the garment in case it contains a volatile organic chemical (VOC). Would not buy again from this seller.

  This is a small fit. Very nice for the price.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love it super cute better for a longer torso it's pretty loose on my stomach I'm 5'2 115 got a small usually wear size 3-5 really got here super fast!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So im 180 lbs and i definitely have a big belly, plus being a mom it kind of hangs a bit and this literally covers up all the unsightly things i don't like about my body, i think it even gives me a bit of curve which naturally i have none really. I absolutely love this!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  After reading the reviews I ordered an XS it fits like a small. I‚Äôm a short woman and the stomach area seems to be for taller women. It‚Äôs a little snug around my private area but not uncomfortable. I‚Äôm 5ft even 130 pounds, I have no boobs lol another reason for the XS. It fits very nice, definitely worth the money! If your short order this a few sizes small. It‚Äôs stretchy i normally wear a medium but will squeeze into a small any day.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this but it def runs small. I sized up, as I always do with amazon lingerie. And I think I am going to buy another one and size up again. So go 2 sizes up maybe. The strings around the hips are small on me because my leggings size is usually a large, and top/dress size a medium. So I need to size up for the bottom half too. And the extra length would be nice since I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù. I think an extra large will be perfect. The large is very nice tho. It digs into my crotch a little, because it‚Äôs a string and it‚Äôs pullinh because I would ideally need more length .

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5‚Äô9, 130 pounds and got a small . Fits nicely , the halter and back are adjustable like a bikini top, and the lace part is stretchy- was worried Id be too tall for it but the halter holds it in place

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'6 and weight 130 lbs. I bought the small and it fit perfectly! Wasn't hard to figure out how to put it on and my bf loved it! The ties around the neck and back made it so that it shaped me perfectly. Not cheaply made at all.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I got this because my husband has been traveling a lot for his job for most of the year and I wanted to spice things up while he was away.  I sent him a few pictures of me in this while he was at work and the outfit got the reaction I wanted ;) I am 5'0 119lbs and the small fit perfect.  I am a small A-cup so it's just the tiniest bit loose around the chest but I just pulled the strings tighter and it was fine.  I highly recommend this product!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Brought this turn up looked a bit small but fitted perfectly. Very comfy missus very happy with it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Esta lencer√≠a le quedo muy bonito a mi esposa , me dejo sin palabras cuando se lo prob√≥

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It arrived with the ""metal"" connecting pieces broken. Not sure what more I can say. Looks like it would have been a nice gift for the missus, now it's just a waste of fabric and money

  Amazing product for an intimate night.

  I like how you can tie it up around the neck. I am small up top and need to adjust. The openings in the front (slits) come up higher than my belly button. Shows off a lil more than what I would like but I will buy full coverage shorts or panties to fix that. Very soft and flowy. I am a large xl in clothing but got 2x from the reviews. Nice fit

  I wanted to do a boudoir photo session for my hubby so I thought you'd would be cute! I'm 5'4 and 200pds and normally a large in everything but I thought I'd go up a size and now I wish I would've gone up another size. My boobs won't fall out of the sides but they do pop out a bit. The shorts fit as well but they are just a bit tight and ride up. The robe is nice and fits too but it doesn't have belt loops as stated in other reviews.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very cute set! I'm 5'5, 198lbs, size large. Shorts are pretty snug, like zero breathing room lol. The bralette fits perfectly. Love the robe, came with a tie but the ribe doesn't have any loops for the tie... that was disappointing.Very soft, silk like material, this green is beautiful! Will purchase again but a size larger than normal.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  In this set there are so many pieces you get your money's worth. The color was perfect for my skin tone and all the accessories were cute. The satin is thin and soft but doesn't collect static as you wear it. It has a silky texture on the skin and the lace and elastic trims are soft and comfortable. The bralet has adjustable straps and the piece along with the underwear has a lot of stretch. I ordered a size small and it was a little big, but not too bad. The underwear has no panty lining.... and the robe has no belt loops but other than that it was a fantastic buy. The shorts are high waisted and cheeky style. The fabric can be easily ironed on low setting. Fabric for shorts and robe are 90% Polyester and 10% Spandex. All edges are rolled hems finished with surging. You can machine wash it, but I suggest a gentle hand washing and hang drying. Made in China. Pretty good quality for a low price. I'll most likely order a few more in different colors!

  I was surprised how much I liked this! I didn‚Äôt expect much for the quality, but it‚Äôs silky and soft and sooo cute. It‚Äôs nice to lounge around in. The lace top fit me well, bottoms too (I ordered medium). The only minor complaint would be the odd bulge that the shorts tend to create at the front when your body is in a certain pose... it can look I guess a little unappealing for photos. But that‚Äôs about it, all else I love about this set!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Okay it‚Äôs cuteHowever everything fit except the shorts.Which I find interesting.The shorts are way too small they are like a size x-large I couldn‚Äôt get them to my knees and everything else I bought same size fits perfectly fine.They definitely did not size the shorts correctly I‚Äôm sad because this was for my bday gathering and I can‚Äôt even wear the shorts.Huge disappointment.If you are full figured I recommend going a couple sizes up because I went one size up and still the shorts only is entirely to small.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Item looks just like the picture. I ordered a small but it is still EXTREMELY too big! Ladies if your petite I‚Äôd advise you to gain weight or not order product lol. Other than the product being overly too big, it is perfect

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Definitely glad I read the reviews. You definitely want to size up or 2. I‚Äôm a large at 5‚Äô7 and 180lbs and the xxl fit perfect. Top is completely sheet but everything fit perfectly. Beautiful material. I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments. Love lounging around the house in this

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super pretty color and the medium fit perfect (: Robe is a little funny and the top is just a piece of lace with straps. Expected quality for only $23üëçüèª

  ¬†I love it. I chose a medium one because I Wanted something little loose for my body and it was perfect, even Small I know it could fits me too. The only think I didnt like it too much was the tie or belt. It is of poor quality, it feels like a gift tie and it is not very soft, it is a bit stiff.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So sexy

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This robe is AMAZING! Super cute and sexy. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 165lbs, ordered a medium and it fits perfectly.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Wore this one night and got pregnant... that‚Äôs all Imma say

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Amazing quality, I loved it! Photographed beautifully!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is a beautiful, sexy robe. I ordered a XXL for my wife who wears size 14-16, is 5'4"", & 40G bra. She loved it. She can cover up other lingerie (or nothing at all) underneath and still look sexy and I can't complain because it's basically almost see-thru. Only negatives were the removable belt that comes with it is cheap and papery & it arrived with a tiny hole (1/2 a pinky nail-sized) torn in the back.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  If I could give this robe 12 stars I would.  I bought it in white, but going to buy the Black as well.  It is SOOOOOOOO sexy.  The definition of sexy.  Like, sexy looks at this robe in envy.  I love the added touch of the gentle lace fringe around the edges!!  It rounds out the overall look of this robe and gives such a luxurious appearance.  I had the collar portion a bit higher on my neck to create a longer line to my cleavage.  Just yes. SO MUCH YES!  And, matching panties included!!  Other brands just give you a cheap, scratchy robe, but not this company!I just love everything about this robe and this company!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This item shipped really fast! The product came neatly packaged. It fits true to size. The ribbon is papery feeling but you can kind of tell that from the picture. Don‚Äôt plan of getting another tie bc it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôll stay on that long anyways. Looks cute without using the ribbon too. Comfortable material, not itchy at all. It looks just like the picture. I got the white one.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  According to measurement, and saying ‚Äútrue to size‚Äù I was supposed to order M, as it is the size I wear. But this product is a very smaller fit! I should have ordered XL! I‚Äôm trying to return it but there is no option for return! So disappointed with this seller.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm a small size but  bought a medium incase and it still doesn‚Äôt reach my bottom. I bought one from Avid love and I love it!  This doesn‚Äôt have a brand name on it. Gstring is not sewn properly.  Unhappy üòû

  As you guys can see I'm a curvy girl and I always have problems finding cute lingerie that's A.) Flattering B.) Cute C.) that both the top and bottoms fit. This set surpassed my expectations. You can't beat the price and it was very easy to put on. Idk why all these girls are on here complaining about not being able to put it in. If you get stuck, there's a picture on the product description.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This thing was so hard to get on ! But i am glad i got it !!! It look amazing üòâ

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is probably one of the best pieces of lingerie i‚Äôve gotten. I‚Äôm pretty curvy, i‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 170 lbs and usually most things aren‚Äôt flattering especially because of my love handles and stomach, but this hit perfectly in all the right places and my husband loved it as well so that‚Äôs always a plus lol. It wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable either I even took a nap in it, and the material was stretchy too. The large fit me well, my bust is a 34DDD and it was still pretty comfortable, didn‚Äôt give me full coverage but it‚Äôs lingerie so i didn‚Äôt need it. I would recommend, especially to my fellow curvy women.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs very cute but not meant for women with big boobs. I ordered an XL and I am a 38DDD. The neck tie cuts because they are on the heavier side.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It is very pretty, but I am 5'2'' about 140 lbs. I wish I could have ordered a small for the top and a large for the bottom. I ordered the medium which did ok for the top since it is adjustable and doesn't look too bad on me but the bottoms are way to tight. For those to look any kind of decent I will need to lose a fair bit of weight. I am normally a medium in most pants (depending on the store), so I figured these would be ok and I did see the curvier model and figure these would also account for women who are curvy. I would order these again if I could separate the sizes because I did feel extremely sexy in the top and know if the bottoms would have fit better I would have been in love with them.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This lingerie fits so well. The bottoms are perfect and the lace is extremely soft. The top is very strappy but the model picture was helpful when figuring out how to put it on. I am 5""1 and I were a size 36D. I ordered a medium which was perfect for me. I was nervous the bottoms would be too big but they fit and were flattering with nothing bulging out of the sides. The top piece was not too tight and I like that it's a halter tie top so I can adjust it to my liking. I really love the softness of the lace. It was wasn't scratchy or tight it was really perfect. After I washed it  hung it to dry because I didn't want to ruin the lace. Great purchase and I would highly recommend this product.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Confusing to put on but very flattering to all body types. I'm 5'3"", 150lbs, 34DD. Gives decent support to the girls for this type of lingerie. Go for it

  ¬†this outfit is so very flattering and sexy when you put it on. it is everything as pictured and it‚Äôs all lace and very beautiful the shape and the cut is very pretty. My boyfriend highly approved of it and it fit true to size I always order a large just because  of breast size and the bottoms are sometimes a little loose but it fit good and looks great. The maroon is a deep dark beautiful maroon and because it‚Äôs all lace I would recommend washing in a laundry bag

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Looks almost as expected - the bra is a bit underwhelming - not much support unless you really tighten the strings behind your neck and then it kinda hurts your neck. Might be better for a bigger chest. The strap around the bottom was a bit of a war (might be a 2 person job).Underwear look as expected, and are pretty stretchy.I got a Small - I'm normally a 32B in a bra and Medium in underwear.(Measurements: 5'7; hips: 41-42"" (all the way around); stomach: 36-37""; waist: 31""; bust 34"")

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I read the reviews and some of them said to size up. My measurements are 26 W and 40 H. So I opted for a large instead of a medium but I definitely could have used a small. I typically buy mediums since I have larger hips and butt however the waist was way too large and I definitely could have pulled off a medium or even a small

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Please don‚Äôt buy it unless you are fit like that girl or your small girl

  I almost sent this back because is clings to the curves and I am not a thin woman.  I am ""well endowed"" shall we say, but my husband loves my curves and loves this on me, so I kept it.  I gave five stars because every time I wear it, I ""get result.""  It fits nicely on top.  Just know that if you are not thin, it will cling to your curves.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is one soft, comfortable, sexy nightgown. The color is a true navy. The fit, style, and length are exactly what I I'm looking for in a nightgown. The adjustable straps are also a plus. I ordered the size medium based on the size chart and other reviews. I'm 5'6"", 160 lbs, 29.5"" waist, and 40"" hips,with an athletic build. I have seen in other reviews that the stitching and/or lace is of poor quality, mine however was in perfect condition and of very good quality. The package arrived on time as well. I'm considering ordering another in a different color. Hope this review helps with your decision. Happy Shopping!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very comfortable and good quality. I'm 5'8"" and 150 pounds. I ordered the medium based on the sizing info. It's a little snug, so I will order the large if I buy it in another color. If you have a perfect midsection, order the medium. If you have a bit of a muffin top, order the large. I'm almost a B cup and the top portion was very flattering and comfortable. If you're above a B, order the large.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My photos are not in the best lighting, but I bought the lite blue nightgown. I love this so much! Seriously, I am considering buying like five more. I could wear this every night. I think it‚Äôs very flattering and it‚Äôs certainly very comfy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Ordered this as something a little sexier than the giant t shirt I normally wear to bed. My boyfriend loves it! It's super comfortable and not too short. Comes just below the butt. The lace underneath the boobs is a little see-through, too, which was a nice surprise.  I'm 5'7"", 120 lbs, 34B-25-34 and ordered the XSmall. It fit perfectly.UPDATE 5/2/2018: this nightgown holds up so well in the washing machine and dryer. Months and months later, it still looks like new and is just as soft and comfy!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I really love this! It's super sexy but still comfy to lounge around the house. There was some question about sizing, I wear a misses 18 or women's 16 and a D cup and got the XL. It fit perfectly and yes it's clingy but not in a bad way. The quality was better than expected considering how affordable this is.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  this slip is so soft and dreamy. the fabric is very comfortable and the lace is a nice touch. the straps are adjustable as well. i ordered the green and it‚Äôs a little more teal in person, not emerald green, but it‚Äôs still lovely.i‚Äôm 5‚Äô4, 130lbs, 34A and the Small fit perfectly. if you don‚Äôt want it as clingy, i‚Äôd size up. it is pretty stretchy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was very pleased with the quality of this nighty! The material is so soft and like a cottony silk bend... That's probably my favorite part about it. Appears to have quality stitching. Arrived on time. Great price. The fit/shape is on par.My 2 qualms with it are silly and meant for more voluptuous ladies: Very thin straps to support big boobies. And although I love the fabric... It really hugs your shape, maybe in less flattering ways if your full figured like myself. With that being said, I WILL BE ORDERING MORE SOON.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great nightie!  Sexy and comfy all in one. Beautiful soft material.  Looks good on me and I have a small bust and tall (180cm, 14b bra 76cm waist 70kg).  I like that the length isn't too short and that it clings tp your figure. So many nightie are old fashioned or sexy but too short!!  I am inbetween sizes at the moment, so I chose the M at first, but I could easily squeeze into the S and ordered several in that size (I am wearing SMALL in the NAVY one and MEDIUM in the red in these photos). I bought so many!!  Get them now!!

  Soft, sexy and comfortable üíï

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It is soooo soft! When I bought it I was expecting for it to have the itchy lace that so often lines women's lingerie, but I was wrong! I will probably buy more in different colors. I will say that the breast area is tiny - mine are Cs, and this fits fine, (barely covering the nip but I want it that way)... so women with larger breasts be aware!I'm 5'4"", 250ish lbs size 16/18. Got the XL and it fits nicely, just long enough to cover the booty

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Beautiful color and super soft material. Great length as well. So many lingerie items are way too short, this actually covers my booty. The fit in the bust is a little odd. The cup portion seems a little small for the ""girls"" and doesn't hold them in place exactly right, but then it is very loose on the sides. Tightening the straps helped a bit. Over all it is very pretty and comfortable, my lady bits just don't always stay in place.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I LOVE this set! I got the dark blue. It fit true to size. I will definitely be ordering in other colors! Its just the right amount of sexy and comfortable! The material is so soft and its very flattering. I bought as something a little sexier than my normal big t shirts to wear to bed (especially when my Honey comes over) and its PERFECT because I wont sacrifice comfort for looks. My honey will see it for the first time tonight and I am looking forward to seeing his reaction. Should be good ;)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This arrived within two days. It looks like the photo, and has an extremely nice/comfortable material. I will say this is something you‚Äôd probably want to wear if you‚Äôre hanging around with your significant other, as women with a bigger bust may have a slip here or there. Women with smaller chests will fair just fine though. I am 5‚Äô9, 170 lbs and I got a medium and it fits perfectly.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Foeant hold up washed twice on gentle and the strap came off.disapointed!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is super cute and so comfortable to sleep in. It‚Äôs stretchy and super soft. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to fall in love with it, but now I wear it all the time to bed, just because it‚Äôs comfortable. I‚Äôll definitely be purchasing more.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Dislike, it appeared to be breast fitting which it is not. I prefer a drawstring or form fitting for my breast since I‚Äôm in my late 40‚Äôs. Very disappointed in this wear.

  Im a curvy size 6 and wear a 36C, this bodysuit has just the right amount of stretch to wear comfortably. Super sexy set with beautiful complementing details, if you‚Äôre thinking about it just buy it! It‚Äôs worth it ;)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is probably the best piece of lingerie I‚Äôve ever bought. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 145 not a perfect body by any means but this thing looks amazing on me! It sits high up on the hips which is super sexy, also it‚Äôs tight but in a good way, holds my breasts up high making them look more flattering. I think I need one in every color. Buy this you won‚Äôt regret it.Lingerie companies should take notes from this one. Absolutely never had a piece look this good on me. In love and hopefully my boyfriend thinks so too üòä

  I am 5‚Äô3 and I generally wear M size, I ordered M, The material is nice,  I am flat chested and it looks great on me and it makes me feel beautiful; but it runs a little bit small, it is not noticeable if you look yourself at the mirror, but you will feel it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  For the price ($16) it‚Äôs not bad. But overall, I don‚Äôt really like it. It‚Äôs too small in places and too big in places. As soon as I took it out of the packaging it was falling apart. The fabric was coming undone. I washed it like you would, only washer no dryer, and it fell apart even more. The crotch slit goes all the way up to my stomach and I don‚Äôt know why. Awkward fit. Wouldn‚Äôt buy again.

  I ordered one of these for myself, and one for my mother in law. The first one was super soft and comforting and I loved it! I loved it so much that I recommended it to my mother in law and ultimately decided to buy her one as a gift. The second one I received was like a men's workout shirt material that was not at all comforting and felt more like a mistake to be honest. The quality between the two is unacceptable. If i wanted a men's workout shirt to sleep in, I would've ordered that. I specifically chose this because the first order was soft and comforting and feminine. The second order was not anything like the first.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bought this for a bachelorette party where we were supposed to bring lingerie (yes I also brought real lingerie) and she LOVED it. She already wears oversized t shirts to bed so for this to be almost like a night gown was perfect. She is about 5'2-5'3 125lb and it comes mid thigh to right above the knee area. True to size, good quality, soft material. 10/10!! Very happy with this purchase.

  This is my new favorite sleep shirt!! It is super soft and fits great! I got it as a gag to wear for a romantic getaway because I wanted to feel sexy without the hassle of real lingerie. I surprised my SO with it on and After all the laughing subsided and he regained composure I knew it was a success!!I will give a bit of a warning to women like myself that are loosing the ongoing battle with gravity, this night shirt will remind you where your breasts should be üòÇ

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this shirt, got it to sleep in. Super soft, it did shrink length wise the first wash. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 and it about halfway covers my bottom. Also 200 lbs and the large fits but isn‚Äôt super loose or right. It does have stretch to it so maybe someone bigger could fit but I‚Äôm not sure it would be too comfy/fit the way it‚Äôs advertised. For the price/quality  I‚Äôd buy it again. Wish it came in bigger/longer sizes for a more nightgown look.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought this one in white then in black. I ordered the same sizes... The white fit me true to size but the black was too small! It was shorter in length by about 3 inches. The black was also made in a different material. Not a fan

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bought as a bachelorette gift. It was super funny and love the print, but the material is weird for a tshirt. Feels like an athletic material you‚Äôd work out in, not something you‚Äôd want to sleep in. Also, the item had a small hole in it that I noticed once she opened her gift. I also thought the sizing ran a little small because the fit should be oversized (to sleep in). The medium looked like it would fit me, and I normally wear a size small. The print fit too high up (the bralette sits above your chest). Overall I‚Äôm happy to have found this and shipped quickly, but wish the item quality would have been better.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I purchased the white XL for myself and the black M for a friend.Overall they are very cute. I have a large chest though and the image of the bra/panties doesn‚Äôt end up anywhere near where it ought to üòÇ I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù, 180lbs, 38ddd, the bra image is way up high on my chest and the panties are up by my belly. Size wise it fits great. I don‚Äôt think ordering up would help much with the image placement for me.The white is very soft- think buttery soft legging material.The black is a different material- slinky/stretchy. Still soft but not what I‚Äôd imagine for a nightgown-doesn‚Äôt seem breathable.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Lol. I love this nightshirt.It's a smooth, synthetic shirt, like athletic material. Very comfy. Loose enough to sleep in, but not loose enough to billow around you (my calf/ankle length grandma style nightgowns always end up bunched up around my waist when I wake up). Great for anyone with a sense of humor.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was expecting a heavier grade material, but love the feel of the jersey even more.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love this night gown! Super cute and comfy

  I love the print (I have two different ones) and it is very comfy to sleep in. Does not support breasts at all. I was hoping it would be tighter around the rib cage to give a little bit of lift. It‚Äôs not. If you have large mom boobs and you wanna go bra-less this is not the nightgown for you... unless you are ok with with your boobs hanging lower than the cup area on the nightie. I wish they made something like this with a shelf bra.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very cute on me got a size larger. Wife like on me. Washes well. Love the pattern. very cute, plan on getting the one with lips on it. I love it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this! It just arrived 10 minutes ago and I already have it on with the tags cut off and everything. I feel gorgeous! I have to wear lounge items a lot bc I have disabilities but still want to feel sexy and cute. I think my honey will like! I LOVE Ekouaer sleepwear and this is my 5th purchase from their collection and my favorite so far. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 100lbs, 32D chest and the small fits just how I like for lounge and sleeping, draping gently & loose enough even if I have an ice cream tummy going on. üòâ The leopard print is fabulous!!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  very cute and comfortable material. Fits comfortably.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  fit perfectly i love it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I would have to say this is one of my favorite nightgowns. Very comfortable and feel fine wearing around house at night. I ordered a medium and wear a medium normally

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was surprised how comfortable it was. I wanted something sexy enough to wear around the house for my husband and modest enough to wear in my house with my children, so this was a good mix. The material was really soft and very comfortable. I‚Äôm going to get some more in different colors.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is the best stretchy nightie!  The comfort makes-up for the not so great stitching. I am going to order more.  The back is a deep v-shape.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Material was faded!! Looks old. Item was true to size but that's about it.

  I love this. It's cute and comfortable. I'm experiencing personal summers especially at night and this is perfect. I plan on buying a few more in different colors. Would recommend for someone who wants something borderline sexy-cute without being naked üôÇ

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This night gown is cute and very soft. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and it hits right at my knees.  It does run a bit big.  I usually wear a 12-14 and ordered an XL, and it‚Äôs a little long on the top.  Instead of returning I just sewed the straps a bit shorter. Will definitely order again, but will size down.Update: I purchased the solid burgundy (the color exactly as pictured) in a size large and it fits much better.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The fit was about a size too large on me.  I don't understand all the positive feedback.  Given the price point, I guess I should have expected what I got. The fabric on both of my mine was like tissue paper.  The first night one of my gowns (the pink tie dye) got a large rip in the fabric in the back for no reason. I had to throw it away. The other one is not much better. I will be pitching it too as its not worth the time to launder it. I should have known better. I will not purchase any more of these brands that pop up on Amazon.  I have been burned by every single one. This is becoming the Ebay of 10 years ago.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I absolutely adore these nightgowns. I had purchased a couple of robes previously in some of the same fabrics and I was delighted to find these to wear under the shirt robes and to have a light weight comfortable nightgown that matches the robes. I think the gowns are beautifully designed and a great value for te price. (I purchased several ... naturally!) ‚ò∫Ô∏è I think the lace really dresses them up and adds some femininity to the gowns.I‚Äôm really about as pleased as can be with these. I‚Äôll be grateful to have them this summer. I feel they fit true to size.Hope this is helpful.‚ô•Ô∏è

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Had to share. Just tried this on and I love it. I will be buying more. It was true to size, the material was soft and it fell nicely over my curves. I would definitely recommend buying this.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Liked style and softness‚Äî‚Äîorder one size downSizes too varied.  Xtra large too big , large a little big but kept it anyway.  Maybe revise size chart ??

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Soft, well made, comfy and still a little sexy. I accidentally ordered a small, I usually wear a medium, but it it fit great even roomy.Ok

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm not sure why I got a red, lace nightgown in a CLEAR plastic bag for delivery. It went to my UPS store where I have a box, and it was very embarrassing. Nightwear is a private matter to me, especially red lacy nightware. I""m just glad it wasn't condoms, adult diapers, or tampons. Maybe revisit your clear delivery bags in regard to personal items. I do like the nightgown, however.

  I dislike wearing much to bed as I move a lot and like to be comfortable and not get tangled up in clothes. I also sleep super hot so wearing heavy or a lot of clothes makes that worse. These are perfect. I've never slept in silk before but always wanted to. I found this set which is perfect. I normally wear a small but ordered a medium which fits perfectly. I wouldn't say it runs small, just that this feels better in a slightly bigger size for me. I was a little worried how the frill would feel, I didn't want it to be itchy. They are not itchy at all. This whole set is super soft and comfortable to sleep in.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I had written a 5-star review about these jammies, loved the fit and quality. Then I noticed that after a week, the black color was rubbing onto my white sheets. Competed ruined a very expensive pair of bed sheets. Super super disppointed, DO NOT BUY!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I looked at the small shorts before putting them on and the thought maybe I shoulda gone up to a medium crossed my mind instantly. The waist band is not overall right or snug as it perceives. I think it‚Äôs just perfect! The top is adjustable in straps which allows for better comfort, and the set is super soft most of all!! 5 Stars !!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'4 around 117, 34-32-34 and I bought a medium. It fits on the smaller side but I carry weight in midsection, but I think a large would be too big. I  LOVE these jammies, and will be buying it in the other 3 colors!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This product is okay, it is not a very high price but I feel like for the price, it is not even worth it. When it came in the mail, the smell was horrible. I hand washed the pjs to try and get the smell out.The material is pretty much 100% polyester. Is is not soft and comfortable. I order these because a fashion blogger recommended them and I don‚Äôt think I can take that advice anymore.They fit small! I wear a medium so I sized up to a large and honestly needed an extra large. They are also made poorly because the crotch area in the shorts is longer than the actual shorts!Don‚Äôt buy! Not worth the price!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Horrible quality! looks really really cheap. Not as seen in pictures. Not ""Lu's"" brand! It's unbranded from China.  I will return it right away!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Looks just like the photo! Good quality, true to size. I typically wear a medium (5‚Äô4‚Äù), sometimes small, but glad I went with the medium. The shorts would have been too small had a sized down I think. Shorts are on the shorter side, as they are cut higher on the side, but they have a wide leg. Top has adjustable straps, I‚Äôve even worn it with jeans and it‚Äôs not too revealing :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought this set for something cool and cute to wear at night. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9, 160 lbs, and ordered a medium and it fits very well! For $20, I didn‚Äôt expect the material to be extraordinary, but I did expect it to hold together!!! Unfortunately, by the second wash, a loose thread made a long, unsightly gash through front of the top, ruining its super cute/sexy appeal. I am really disappointed because up until now, I loved the set!On the bright side, I don‚Äôt see any other reviewers having this problem. The complaints about the lower fabric quality don‚Äôt seem very fair considering the price of the set. Any high quality satin pajama set is going to be upwards of $50, so for the price of this set, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty good!

  I was a bit hesitant about buying it because I have thick thighs and did not want it to look tight on me but it doesn't. Perfect fit and the material is great. Super happy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not completely thic leg friendly but it worked well. I would recommend this to someone with smaller thighs for sure but definitely a good perchase for the money!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am a plus size girl, but losing weight. So the garter didn‚Äôt feel super comfortable at the moment because my legs are a little larger but I think by the time my wedding comes around, it will fit better. They definitely feel soft and well made - I don‚Äôt regret my purchase. I would recommend them unless you need a larger diameter. Maybe check the measurements.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  we bought this for a sissy boy outfit for him at a theme dance: Victor Victoria.... REALLY CUTE.  matches his sissy frill blue panties [with crotch for men].This piece is being used to tear apart and made into a sissy frill sock...He has 1/2 half man's suit and the other 1/2 girly stuff.... REALLY a push but ... hey whatever it's a one time deal

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It's one of those things where it looks so much better in person. I was hesitant and when I tried it on absolutely loved it. For reference I'm usually 29/30 in pants and got the medium. Fits like a charm.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This was a last minute purchase that my daughter needed for her friend. In all of the preparations for the wedding it was the one thing the bride had forgotten all about. I had it sent directly to my daughter and they got it within two days!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs very basic and pretty, I bought mine in blue and it comes with 2 pieces.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This garter is so sweet and classic. I am so excited to wear it on my wedding day and it even comes with a smaller one to toss. I honestly think for $9 you can't do any better. Except for maybe the slightly cheaper wedding garters at Party City but they don't have the satin and cute bow. I will deifnitely be saving this for my daughters to use for their weddings. It is just darling and super sweet looking!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  very elastic, doesn't cut into your thighs, so comfy to wear

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very quick delivery and much nicer than the garters you find in shops. Also matched our bridesmaid dresses!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These are lovely and good value for money

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I wore this for my wedding, very good quality.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Quick shipping. Very good quality. Something new , and somethig blue. Ideal gift for wedding or Hens. Thank you. 5 star

  I ordered both a large and a medium as I wasn‚Äôt sure how they were going to fit. I ended up liking the fit of the medium much better; however, the medium arrived damaged. Right between the breast the stitching had come undone. I ended up sending it back and the replacement arrived in perfect condition. The material is very soft and flows. The color is true to the pictures.34D with 30‚Äù waist for reference

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Perfect fit

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I like to wear cute comfy night gowns. This one is my new favorite. It came earlier than expected,  excellent condition,  and great quality.  It came with a matching thong. The breast area is not push up it is lined with lace,  but there is a seam underneath your breast and the straps are adjustable so it is flattering.  I bought the small.  I am 5'6"" Victoria secret 32C and about 135lbs. I love the red color and the fabric is veryyyy soft!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bought this set for a boudoir shoot. It was honestly the best decision.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 around 110 pounds.  It‚Äôs sexy and comfortable.  I really like the detail on the back!  Soft, stretchy material is very cling and shows the outline of everything (panties, hipbones).

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fit as expected, go up one side.  I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù195 lbs usually a size 14 ordered a XL. Good quality, fast shipping, totally worth it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Came a bit wrinkled (which I expected), but AMAZING! it's comfortable and sexy, the light, flexible material clings to your body in all the right ways!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Loved, perfect for some boudoir pictures!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is a nice piece! My hubby liked it on me. I got navy blue very soft fabric. Adjustable straps help keep the girls in but not totally secure enough for sleeping. Good buy for the price washes well

  It‚Äôs a smaller fit to other styles

  LOVE! Smooths out tummy great as well as hiding it and flatters curves so well! i will for sure order another one it is so sexy and soft and very stretchy! if you are thinking about buying it trust me its worth it! im 230 lbs 5‚Äô5 but my stomach is small for my size

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I loved it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love it. As a girl with a belly I was kind of nervous about if I'd look like a busted can of biscuits in this boy was I wrong!! Looks an feels great I will say with if you wear a Womens 14 I would go with an XL just because YES it does strech buttttt not a lot. I myself am I between an 12 an 14 depending on the brand an I got a L but XL mite have been just a little better but the L still looked great! If anything the L helped ""the girls"" perk up. An that's another thing I'm a 38 DDD/F and it worked perfect the V pattern an the halter string help the perk up. Hope this helps

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 205lbs and this stretches to fit my curves and my thick figure. I like it a lot. At first It looks small but, ‚Äúgirls it will fit just about anyone‚Äù.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Sexy lingerie even for plus size ladies. I'm a 20-22 and bought the 22 it's a little snug getting it on but very cute. Will buy other colors

  I was a lil worried pulling it.out of the pkg it looked way to small ...but after putting it on DAMN I was feeling it. I didn't look like a busted can of biscuits...I was looking GOOD!!!!!! I did go up a size I'm normally and XL and I got a XXL!!!! Big girls BUY this you won't be disappointed I promise!!!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Looks just like the picture and good quality. Did not tear when I put it on. I just don‚Äôt have the figure for it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Loved it . So did my honey bun ;)The halter part is a bit funny fitting but still nice

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Doesn‚Äôt worth the money

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great

  Totally love it got it in the yellow waiting now for the black absolutely sexy and sultry!!!!

  This is a full set which is nice. I‚Äôm not a fan of the upper body section as this is a one size fits all one-piece. Obviously the product is shown on a woman with implants but it is not nearly tight enough to provide any kind of perky support for me (a c-cup post motherhood). I‚Äôm not sure if Amazon will delete the photo, but the goal is to show you what natural breasts look like in the lingerie. Overall, it looks great on. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù, the length was perfect and could easily fit someone taller. I‚Äôm also 155lbs and it fit well all around.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is my new favorite! For reference I am 5'6, 205lbs 38DDD-36-45.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  All I can say is wow‚Ä¶ Bought this for my girlfriend for her birthday. Ended up being one of our favorites I‚Äôve ever bought her. The strappy look of this set is what drew me in initially. The sheer criss cross front gives a very unique, elegant and sexy look that she and I both love. (She said no to posting pics, since she feels that‚Äôs supposed to only be for me to see. üòç) Very easy to put on like a T-shirt due to the one piece design. Fabric is super soft and stretchy, and seems like decent quality for the money. (For girls on the larger side, might not be best though since there‚Äôs obviously not a lot of ‚Äúsupport‚Äù‚Ä¶) Only con I can find is it‚Äôs pretty much impossible to access her upper half during the heat of the moment, unless you rip it off her‚Ä¶ Lol Lower half is total free access though once the optional g-string is removed. Which, is a requirement for me when it comes to buying her lingerie‚Ä¶ Because otherwise, what‚Äôs the point right? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£The strappy stockings and gloves make this outfit really pop, and made her feel even more beautiful and sexy than she already is‚Ä¶ For reference, she is 5‚Äô4‚Äù 115-120 pounds. Fit her perfectly, 5/5 stars! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I have another set like this that I like much better. This one is several pieces that takes quite a bit of time to get on. It has a garter belt that you have to snap on to the leggings.  I am 5'5"" and 125 pounds with long legs but the fit on this was super big in the legs. I feel like it could fit someone a foot taller than I.  I was super disappointed that it is nylon stocking material and runs super easy. In fact, it had a run in it right out of the package. On a positive note, it was fun and sexy to wear and my sweetie loved it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  A small issue I ran across with this is that up close it's really easy to see this isn't a thicker fabric laced up. It grows more sheer the larger you are ladies! When I was trying these on, the fabric began to rip in the stockings where the garter belt attaches, so caution! This is a very fragile outfit and for $40 I'd expect just a bit more quality.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The product was 1 size fits all and it was just too too tight even with the ‚Äúmeasurements‚Äù. Also if you return they charge more than 50% for a restocking fee. I will not be buying from the again as that is such a rip off if something doesnt fit. It‚Äôs a shame.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The sheer panels are not very sheer. It does not have a strappy look to it. It looks like a solid piece with a pattern. It is a was still very cute, fit well, and felt nice to wear. I would totally wear it again if it hadn't gotten destroyed. **No fault of product, my hubby can be rough with clothing when allowed. This actually held up longer than many.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  First of all, this product cost $5 to make so was  priced too high in my opinion.  The body suit portion was clever and reversible.  The connection to the thigh high stuck well to the stockings; however, they were too short for my long legs.  So don‚Äôt recommend if you are 5‚Äô8‚Äù or taller as it was one size fit all.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Looks great on

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I just wish the stockings stayed up a little bit better. It's pretty well made but not something I will wear often.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I checked the size and quality but it‚Äôs small and has very bad quality. I‚Äôm afraid that it will be ripped out if I try to put it on.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  thank you very much...i love it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It is a little bit long for my height.

  First of all, do not buy this if you have big boobs, because it offers zero support and will not even like fit on your boobs in any way. Secondly, the material is so cheap and scratchy and uncomfortable and will irritate your nipples. Thirdly, I got this in 2 sizes and on of them came in a bag that literally wouldn't even open. Extremely bad...returning.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The bows were smaller than expected, but other than that it‚Äôs great material and a great product! I look stunning in it and so will you!  Order it!! It‚Äôs worth it! Man looking at the tv more thank you? Well I can guarantee he will definitely be staring at you if you buy this product!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not great quality. Price way too high for an item like this made like this.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The bottoms fit fine. The top was awful. The hearts were no where near my nipples the underwire was half the size of my breasts.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I like the product, but when I received it one of the straps was broken.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very sexy, husband loves it,

  I had no idea it actually came from Shien. Very comfortable material. I fit a size XL but unfortunately they didn't have it in that size. I was still able to fit a large but it was definitely a little tight. My boyfriend loves It

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Sexy, comfortable, flattering- even two months postpartum. Enough pieces for a good game of strip poker :) SOOOOO worth it for a bit of fun and a confidence boost

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Normally I wear xs/s and it was slightly too big, I had to make some adjustments to fit my size but other than  that I love everything about it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not true to size at all

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The center line was to small for a person with a long torse. The section that goes over the breasts has no support it is just a flat piece of material. If you don't have perfect round full breast it looks ridiculous.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Cute little outfit.  There are so many little pieces it‚Äôs easy to lose something. But it is fun!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs a good material. It‚Äôs stretchy. Apron is long enough to go around anybody. It‚Äôs cute and comfortable!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I thought it was a good product and very good material. My husband loved it! The bottom part is a little uncomfortable in the butt, but I won't wear it for longer than a couple of hours so it's all good.

  ¬†(I‚Äôve bedazzled my piece a bit here.)I bought the small and it fits really well. The bottoms are a bit tight but that‚Äôs common with sets for me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô0 and petite. Definitely worth it. So cheap too

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I can make it look okay for pictures, but it makes me look like a rectangle. I have an hour glass figure so I'm not sure how that works but I'll never wear this in front of someone unless they are want to tear something off.There's also no cup so its just going to flatten your breast.Just don't buy it lmao.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I followed the size guide. There's no room in the ""cups"". It's just flat fabric that doesn't stretch. I couldn't even get the thing on

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought several different lingerie pieces from different makers, but this one was by far my favorite. I read a lot of reviews before purchase to make sure I got the sizing right, and it fit perfectly! Of course the material isn't the best, but it was still really cute on. It looked exactly like the pictures so that was a bonus. I'm a 34B up top and wear around a size 4 pant and ordered a small.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The cup size was too small, for me. the overall size was too big. The style was cute on top, the bottoms were not right. Huge. I got a large- I wear a 36D to 36DD. 5‚Äô4‚Äù 135lb.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5‚Äô3 and about 140lbs with a large B/small C cup with a big natural booty. I‚Äôm a curvy little girl so finding things that fit my body well is so important‚Ä¶especially when you want to feel confident in the bedroom. I bought a size small because I would rather have it fit my chest area since nothing fits my bottom area. It was as expected. Fit my breast well and held them up well, but the thong was a little small around my coochie and tight straps around my butt. My husband did not complain though, he loved it and loved the fit üòâ it‚Äôs his favorite so far and I have some pricy lingerie. Can‚Äôt believe this Amazon find is his fav.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this set. Materials are all stretchy enough to sleep in. Button is a hipster type brief. The bra has front closures and is adjustable at breast plate and straps. I‚Äôll be shopping for a similar style with this seller. I hope the quality and fit stays the same.Me: pear shaped body 5‚Äô4‚Äù approx 150 +/- 4 lbs usually wear size 10 bottoms I purchased a medium. I could wear a smaller size but I plan on sleeping in this and it‚Äôs so comfortable üíïand cute.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So I am 5‚Äô5 150 lbs. Typically medium-large in normal clothes. I ordered an XL and it fit wonderfully! I carry much of my weight in my chest/stomach area so the bottoms were a smidge big on me but definitely still flattering.The quality is beautiful, not tacky looking or cheaply made.I hardly have luck with lingerie items off Amazon that work for me and my body type, but this one takes the cake. Highly recommend this product. üëç

  Perfecto!, y muy lindo!

  First off, I am a 5'6"", 145 lbs woman and these fit me great. They stretched out to look just right. I was surprised by how well they stayed up too (not perfectly, but really good). However, I wouldn't say my thighs are particularly big and these fit snugly around them. You may find them to be too tight there because there isn't much give. I also have very sensitive skin and after a while of wearing them, they felt a little itchy. Nothing to dramatic though. Overall, they worked well for me but it's possible they wouldn't be great for everyone.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not for short girls. I've never had to but anything but O/S these were extra long so where the top ended was almost to my hip. Not a good fit for me

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was hoping to wear these with garters, but I didn't read the description. These stocking have silicone stickies in the lace top to prevent sliding!Good quality and very cute stockings. Definitely my fault for not reading.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Lovely.  Bought it for a photoshoot.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love these, first time buying fishnets and I am not disappointed. My boyfriend sure isn‚Äôt either! The silicone bands at the top help keep them up but I bought a garter belt anyways just to complete the look. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 size 0 and they fit perfect!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These stockings complimented my outfit. They had enough stretch and when taken off and put back on they fit the same as if it was not worn before. The fabric is sturdy and I did not have any issues like I had with other stockings that tear.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  They were super tight at the thigh with no stretch at all. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 140lbs so if you are bigger than I am, just don‚Äôt get them. Also they‚Äôre really long for short girls so don‚Äôt get them if you‚Äôre short. But if you are tall and skinny these are perfect.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought this for my sexy where‚Äôs Waldo costume and everything about them slaps except that they don‚Äôt stay up. I got me some thiccy thighs too. I‚Äôm talking too raw hams in these booty shorts. I‚Äôm talking ridonkulous. The elastic was not enough and as I strut my way through the city they slip n slided down my pork buns like it was sliding into my DMs. Appearance? Great. Practicality? Ass

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Delivery was fast. Nice quality and don‚Äôt fall down! Love them the only problem is they are a little tight on the thigh and I‚Äôm a size 10 so they run a little small.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I wish I could pull them higher without them rolling over/squeezing awkwardly. If there's a size option, size up if you've got big thighs

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I've got thin legs and they fit well

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Too tight on the thighs. Only for no thighs people, note that I am average. Ok quality but not worth the price. Also, note that it says: One size fits MOST and not One size fits ALL. Not for Regular thighs üòÖ

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Good quality for price, stretch allows a fair degree of flexibility in how high you want them to go and how wide your legs are.

  I absolutely love this and it fits me perfectly! My husband went crazy! Must buy ladies!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This was completely perfect for the price. The package contained everything but stockings. I took the choker off just because that wasn‚Äôt the vibe I was going for. The lace obviously is cheap, so I‚Äôm hesitant to just throw it in the washer. The thick straps that surround the lace are all elastic and VERY comfortable. When I put this set on, i didn‚Äôt have to undo anything. I slipped right in to it. I‚Äôm also not very thick, but this set DEFINITELY gives you shape.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am an exotic dancer so any piece of clothing has to be flattering, fit comfortably, and have stretch enough to where I can move and Shake. I'm not saying that this is one of my favorite outfits, but what I will say is I make some pretty good money in this! I am 5' 2"" and around 190lbs. The XL fits well and stretches enough to fit a was of ones.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This set is flattering and true to size. I ordered size Large and I'm 5'5"", about 170lbs and 36DD. As you can see I have a little bit of a roll situation on my sides and back, so if you do as well the bottom harness strap can unfortunately accentuate that, but the material is very comfortable. I feel that going the next size up would have made the bottoms too loose but that's just my particular body shape. I recommend this set regardless, it's so sexy and will have you feeling hot!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  True to size, I got a large for comfort and stretch..

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fit me perfect!  I got a small I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 curvy around 130-140. Top fit very nice, I was nervous when I saw the bottoms because they didn‚Äôt have much stretch and I have a big butt but they fit and were very flattering.Really nice structure and quality!! True to size!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am a large bottom and 34A bra.  I can not fit in a med bottom so I got the large set hoping for the best.  I am actually very happy with the overall fit!! With the hook and loops on the smallest setting the top fits just fine.  There is room for a larger chest but still looks flattering on my lil girls lol! The. Only piece that looked to big was the removable choker and it still looked acceptable.  I highly recommend this set! For the price it‚Äôs worth it!!!‚Äô

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I don‚Äôt normally write reviews, but clothes - especially lingerie - always benefit from reviews. So if you‚Äôre thinking about buying this item, do it!! The idea of $15 lingerie made me skeptical too, but I decided to give it a try after reading all the other positive reviews, and it is so worth it!The quality of this item is really nice, and I love that almost everything is adjustable (the chocker, the bralette, and the garter belt all have hook and eye clasps). Some of the straps on the bralette are a little loose, but that‚Äôs easily fixed with some minor tailoring.I ordered an XXL, despite normally wearing an XL, because I‚Äôm 6‚Äô5‚Äù and have learned the hard way that I need to order lingerie a size up to account for the length of my legs and torso. Overall, this is a great item and well worth the money; I highly recommend it!!

  I love it! Thank you!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Wow! I‚Äôm a harsh critic when it comes to lingerie because I‚Äôve gained quite a bit of weight lately and I‚Äôm extremely self conscious. I have to say this mini chemise/teddy is absolutely gorgeous on. I bought the dark green. Be warned it‚Äôs more of a slate or steely dark blue. It‚Äôs goes really well with my fair complexion and auburn hair, but I guarantee it would look great on nearly any skin tone.  I adore Avidlove‚Äôs style, but they are so hard to size for my body type. This time I got lucky. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù 175lbs and 38 D/DD and the XXL fit perfectly. The g-string is too big, but I don‚Äôt mind. This is the first piece that has actually accentuated my natural chest rather than squash them or force them to the sides. Most lingerie is designed for perky breasts or implants, but this would suit nearly everyone!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love this chemise so much that I‚Äôm going to order another one.The cut is very flattering. The lace part is stretchy so it‚Äôs very forgiving if you‚Äôre larger on top, it still holds it‚Äôs shape nicely and holds everything in place, not cheaply made.I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù and around 165lbs, the large was perfect

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I purchaed this for my daughter to wear on her wedding night.  She didn't want white, she wanted purple which is her favorite color.  It's beautiful.  I LOVE the color!  I think she and soon to be hubby wiill like it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  If you have a full figured body, this is the one you want. By the deminsions listed, I am a 2X. With that said, it fit really great. I am picky, I don't like rolls to hang anywhere, I never try to squeeze into something, if you go a tad bit larger it looks slimming. That is how I shop for all clothing. When it is on, it fits nicely. That is what I am always going for. I was amazed at how well this fit. I am 5'6' with a 38DD bust and big butt. If that tells you anything. I don't have a small waist but it is smaller than my bust and bum. So there are curves to work with. So I thought the pink fit good. I quickly bought another one in black. The material isn't top of the line but not super cheap either. There is never enough bust support in items like these but this one works. The straps are criss crossed in the back. Something I noticed does a world of difference. Hope this helps.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Just as pictured and described. Nice fabric. Soft lace. Comfortable elastic straps. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô0‚Äù, 108 lbs, 34c/d (93 cm). I ordered the silver tone. It covers and hugs the girls nicely.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My wife loves this. Great value for the $$$$! You wont regret the purchase.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My GOSH! I love this little nighty. It's so sultry and well made. I purchased the dark green option and the color is rich and accurate to the color in the picture. It goes wonderfully with my pale skin and red hair. The back of the garment emphasizes my curves perfectly with the straps and cut of it. I am 5'3"", 125 pounds, 34D cup and I went with a size small. It hugs me perfectly and doesn't look stretched or too tight. I just washed it in a lingerie bag in my washing machine and air dryed it and it turned out perfectly! Two thumbs up from the boyfriend, as well.

  Ein tolles Blau das auch so rauskommt. Es ist recht kurz aber von der Passform echt super. Ein sehr sch√∂nes Neglig√© und das Satin hat auch etwas

  Hat sehr gut gepasst (wer es knapp sitzend mag), das Material f√ºhlt sich sehr gut auf der Haut an und die M√§nner sind mit so einem kurzem Nachthemd sehr leicht zu vom TV weg zu bekommen!Zum Schlafen ist es fast zu schade, aber daf√ºr wurde es auch nicht gekauft  ;-)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Sch√∂nes Nachthemdchen, tolle Farbe, gute Verarbeitung - aber der String ist viel zu gro√ü, sehr seltsam geschnitten und wohl nicht verwendbar. Aber auf das Oberteil kommt es an und wir werden jede Menge Spa√ü damit haben, denke ich ;) F√ºr den Preis ist es absolut ok.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Die Qualit√§t der Nachtw√§sche war fantastisch und meine Frau war begeistert, da der Stoff glatt und angenehm zu tragen war. Danke f√ºr das Produkt und wir haben es wirklich geliebt.

  I'm 5'5, about 155 lb, 34B bra, with an hourglass/ athletic shape.I'm not comfortable to share a photo, but it looks so good that I could!The top fits perfect Medium for a 34B! I like that the straps sit wide and hide my armpit pudge.The bottoms are a little small, but very sexy. They're not tight, just less fabric... I have a huge butt and big thighs, so I was satisfied that the bottoms don't cut into my hips or give me ""muffin top"" at all. But yeah, they're teeny-tiny/ low rise.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Absolutely love this set! Looks great if you have a small chest (like me!). I read several reviews from Shein, Romwe and on Amazon before ordering to figure out what size to get. I‚Äôm usually a small for tops and a med/lg for bottoms (135lbs). The large fit me perfectly! I do have A cups so I don‚Äôt quite fill out the bra, but if it was any smaller it wouldn‚Äôt be able to strap around my chest comfortably. Overall, with the straps loosened all the way, it looks gorgeous. Love love love it. Cannot wait to show this to my boyfriend for V-day!EDIT: Strap in the front snapped when I tried it on for V-Day and Amazon REFUSES to  exchange it. Amazon is also demanding the broken set be returned to them, even though they apparently cannot exchange it since it was sold through a different seller. Honestly this is Amazon‚Äôs fault more than Shein‚Äôs, go ahead and purchase through shein.com and not here in case you have any issues!

  Me encanta como me queda el conjunto, la talla es exactamente c√≥mo lo indica.El material es muy c√≥modo y muy sexy para una ocasi√≥n especial.La tela es de buena calidad, creo que compar√© en otros colores :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I wanted a basic sexy set so this was exactly what i needed! I am between a medium and large so I ordered both. I found that both fit well for my body type. (The medium is without fishnets and the one with the fishnets is a large)  I obviously feel more comfortable in the large since i have a bit of a wiggle room with the adjustable straps but also with the large I am at the most tightest length. The medium looks good as well! buuut what I did find was that the size large panties fit WAY better than the medium (it just doesn't cover my majora/mound as much) and the chest in medium fits WAY better than the large. SO if you are like me, i would honestly just recommend the medium since its tight and you can adjust the bra. (and maybe pair it with some other cute panties)  ALSO don't speak for all! always measure yourself before!!This might have been a confusing insight, but overall it is such a cute set that I know ill shrink into. and they pair well with fishnets! (also on amazon)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am have a classic hour-glass figure. I purchased a small, the bottom fits well, but the top is WAY TOO SMALL. Plus, there is no way to adjust anything on either piece. I am keeping the set because it‚Äôs not worth the trouble to return it, and I can still wear the bottom. All in all, not worth the money in my opinion. I could just purchase a pair of bottom like this for less.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered this in red as well as black. They both fit great.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs cute but if I move my arms up the top looks weird. Just doesn‚Äôt stay in place well because of the way the band is set up. It‚Äôs also a little too big but I‚Äôm small so

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  SO CUTE! I'm quite petite and find lingerie usually looks baggy and is hard to feel confident in but this fits me so well! I'm 5'4 and weigh about 110 pounds. it runs small, I got an s but usually wear xs and there's no extra baggage room anywhere. super cute for an intimate night.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Items are not the same as pictured. I bought the white in medium. It is absolutely hideous in person. The fit is terrible. There‚Äôs zero quality to this item and it boggles my mind as to how this set has such high ratings.I‚Äôm a 34DD.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Lo compr√© para mi novia y le gust√≥ y a mi me encant√≥.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Took a long time to ship:/// my tibbies would out the bottom some times. Not super comfortable

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The set is fabulous and true to size. Loving the fit and color.

  It appears this item was purchased either just before or just after my wife and her new man declared their ""Relationship"" to the people on Facebook. I can only assume the introduction of this Snap Crotch Teddy helped them to move forward. Any piece of clothing with that kind of power is worth purchasing.

  ¬†It‚Äôs Like A Half A Size Too Big & I Ordered A Large. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 & 158lbs. But Other Than That, 10/10!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs very cute and sexy. Wore it out to the bar and it fit perfectly. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and currently 180 pounds, 34 DD and I bought a large.  It can be worn without a bra or pasties and nothing can be seen. No bra support but looks super cute and sexy! Definitely would buy again and recommend!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Just as described, I did not wear anything to cover my nipples since there is a little more fabric around the breast area and also the private area but I did have on a thong which came from a separate purchase. Got it for a lingerie party and I felt very sexy in it with the robe I combined it with.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is hot. Comfortable, stretch material! Fits great, should be fun! I am 161 lbs 5'4"" and 34DD fits like a glove. Not the most breast support but still looks great!

  Bought this for my fianc√©e as a Valentine‚Äôs Day gift for myself. Lol. Looked amazing on her for the 30 seconds she got to wear it. Fit perfect. Pretty sure I‚Äôm gonna be a dad now so, feel free to find more of my reviews in the baby section üòÇ

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Wow, very comfy demure & sexy. My hubby loves any white lingerie or gown. This will do it. I'm usually an 18/xxl & the xxx us perfect. Get this ladies!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love the loose fit. Not too flowy/ not too long. Beautiful üíãI ordered xl: I am 215# and 38F chest

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love this lace babydoll top! The lace is delicate yet soft and beautiful. Even though it is sheer, it softly disguises your imperfections... this is a win for self conscious women with mom tummies! I am an older woman of large stature, and bought this in black to surprise my husband on our Anniversary... he was very pleased, and repeatedly told me how beautiful and sexy I was in it! He absolutely loved it, and asked me if I could get one in red (I ordered it in red and 1 other color)! Note: The red was more a bright orange red (not like the color in the photo), so I exchanged it for the dark red. I didn't wear the skimpy thongs as they didn't compliment my size.I could even see wearing this with a camisole underneath as a sexy top for a date night.For reference, I ordered a 2x and it fit me good. I have wide hips of 51-52‚Äù... if your hips are wider than that, I would size up, I had just enough room without it being snug. My bust is  40D, 235 lbs, 5‚Äô7‚Äù tall. I hand wash them and let them air dry to preserve the delicate lace. You can‚Äôt go wrong with these, they are lovely (I own 3 now)!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered this for a getaway my husband and I went on and kept it a surprise for him. Wow, it‚Äôs so sexy and comfortable at the same time. I ordered a small as I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 and 112lb. It fit perfect! He absolutely loves it too. Thank you Avidlove!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I have bought several different ones in various colors and am happy with all of them. Soft material, sexy and reasonably priced. My husband loves all of them! I highly recommend any of the chemisis from this company.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I absolutely love this! I bought it for my honeymoon. It‚Äôs so comfortable and makes me feel very sexy. I‚Äôve been wearing it to bed and just around when we are inside during the day. Absolutely perfect.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  buy one size smaller, but this is beautiful, so nice I can't believe the price and it is very forgiving if your on the pump side. I', 4""10 and 160 but it is very sexy, short but hides the thighs. It's GORGEOUS I ordered anther one in red.

  I'm 5'7 157 & i ordered a medium. Should of got a small but still look nice! It have stretch to it. Going to order in another color but in a small. White thing is tag and I noticed strap wasnt placed correctly under breast....excuse messy dressor lol

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is fantastic! As someone who has a hard time buying clothes online due to my size- this was a miracle fit!I'm 5'2 but 190lbs [yes, I'm pudgy and short- I've got a lot going for me with a combo like that]- Chest size it about a 36C and my ass has its own ass. I usually run into issues with fitting in two areas: either everything fits but the boob cuppage area is loose [I could fit an orange in there], or, things don't zip/clasp/close due to my bust or hips.This is soft, stretchy and FITS EVERYWHERE just like it should! It also has adjustable staps so you can loosen or tighten as needed. I like that it's not a 'one size fits all' and can be adjusted where needed. Need it bigger on bottom but tighter on top- YOU GOT IT! Need it bigger to fit your melons but smaller around the waist? YOU GOT IT- IT'S MAGIC.I never buy lingerie online- but this....this is a real gem. It makes me feel sexy and confident and plays with my curves in a flattering way instead of making me look like a short, stuffed sausage.10/10 would recommend.[*I bought a XXL to be careful based on my normal sizing and it's a perfect fit]

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The style grabbed my attention, because I felt like it would accentuate my small breasts and distract from my other imperfections. I think it does a good job at that. I've never had the confidence to wear lingerie for my husband, but I feel this piece gives me the confidence to come out of my shell. I know I need to work with what I got and just own it! The lingerie is not exactly the blue color that the model is wearing, but it's still pretty. I'm 5'9 and 185 lbs. 36 B cup. Size 14 pants. The size medium fits perfect. The material has some stretch to it. I can adjust straps if I need it looser or tighter on the sides. It seems to be well made and durable quality. This piece was a great price, and much much cuter and unique compared to the items I see on display at the mall.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Flattering. True to size.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Just stunnin'

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was skeptical about the fit at first. I was thinking, ‚ÄúHow could something do strapping fit multiple body types?‚Äù Well, it fit me perfectly! I‚Äôm 5ft tall and 125lbs and I ordered a small. This is now my new favorite piece of lingerie (maybe my husband‚Äôs too?)! I feel so sexy in this!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Ordered this for my girlfriend. We both love it! She says it's very comfortable and it fits very well. It's quite stretchy and adjustable, and has a nice and soft feel to it. Looks absolutely amazing on her!!! She's 5'10"", ~140 lbs and 34 B, I got her the medium.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'7"" and 140 lbs and I ordered the small after reading the reviews from other's who ordered and it fits perfectly. I feel very sexy in it. It hugs your curves and accentuates everything in such a lovely way. I was trying to find some cute outfits like this at Victorias secret, but they are between 70-100$$$. I ordered this before I went on a little vacation with my love and he went crazy over it. The back is just like a g string. For the price, I am very satisfied.

  Edit, two years later!This lingerie is still fantastic! It's lasted well, without any of the lace falling apart or becoming scratchy. It's stood the test of several costumes, as well as getting rave reviews in my love life. I bought another color about a year ago (red), which was a great vibrant color, exactly as pictured, and felt and fit the same as the first one. I may just buy another color this year!2019 review:Oh my god. This is great. I'm 5'1"" and about 275lbs, which I carry around my lower belly, butt, and thighs. I purchased the 4X. This item is amazing. It fit perfectly. Some things to note in particular:- It's not scratchy. It's very comfortable. Sometimes lace and fishnet material gets scratchy, but this is not just comfortable but borders on soft.- The crotch snaps are barely noticeable. You know they're there, because you saw them or used them to put it on, but you can't feel them when the item is actually on.- The straps are adjustable. This really helped me because I was able to adjust the straps so the top of the teddy actually held my boobs in place (I wear a 42DD).I'm just honestly really overwhelmed. I ordered this item to use for Halloween, and I had my doubts. It didn't have very many reviews, but it was a low price, so I went for it. It came within two days (Prime), fit exactly like I wanted it to, and, the cherry on top, it was a low price. I highly recommend this. Plus size girls gotta stick together, so I made sure to write this review right after trying it on.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm very happily surprised at how nice this is for the price! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù currently 140 Lbs & 34D. I‚Äôve gained 10-15 lbs recently and carry that weight in my belly and chest so I wanted something to cover that.  I have a short torso and this fits great lengthwise so I‚Äôm not sure if it would be great for someone that‚Äôs taller, but there are adjustable straps to give a little extra room. There is no support in the bust, but with the way it‚Äôs low cut, it still looks great. Also, fits awesome on the butt. It cuts high up and doesn‚Äôt leave anything to the imagination in the back, but with the front covered, that‚Äôs a plus. I‚Äôm surprised at how soft it is too!Only con is that it smells like chemicals. I hand washed it in the sink and it bled badly. I‚Äôd suggest only handwashing for this reason.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 190lbs and I got this in a XL. I LOVEEE this! I felt very confident and sexy when I tried it on and my boyfriend liked it too!! I wanna wear this everyday

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'9 165lbs. 40,35,43 measurements. I ordered the Xl and the fit is amazing. The quality is suprising for the cost. The lace is soft and silky, not itchy like some other lace lingerie I have purchased. The button closures are quality. The color is exactly as advertised. Excellent quality and find for a cheap price!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Loved this body suit! It fit like a glove great quality!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I absolutely love this outfit. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 145 lbs with 36 DDDs at my age I‚Äôm super proud of them üòù. I got a large and it fit good. Little loose on the rear cause all my goods are up top (unfortunately). I paired this with a black mini shirt and strapped heels for a night out.  I threw over a white button up just in case people said anything.  I‚Äôve never felt sexier.  My husband was happy.  Win win

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'3 and 150lbs. Womens size 6/8. I am hippy. The medium is way too tight down below, but I bought this as lingerie so, it serves its purpose. I could never wear it out in day light with an outfit. The V comes way further down below than the photos portray. But I do realize that I may need a large. But again, its fine for me. I would say order a size up. The material and quality is as expected. Thank u!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Really happy with this item! I am 5'6"" and a 42D cup and a size 20 in pants, I wear a 1 or 2 in stores like Torrid for panties, I carry all my weight in my tummy due to diastasis recti. I wish this had just a liiiiiiittle more chest support, but the cleavage angle is flattering anyway. The lace is a nice thickness and I like the strategic panels that offer peekaboo but not totally sheer. I ordered a 4X and I don't think changing size would make a difference; it fit just right in terms of tightness, not uncomfortable but not too loose either. I may buy it in more colors! It came in a frosted plastic zip-top bag.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great quality and fast delivery ! Fits perfect to my size !!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  survived in the drier but should air dry, dress to success in the bedroom ;)

  Fits perfect!!!

  ¬†Great buy great fit  the material is amazing nice and strong so it won‚Äôt rip when putting it on the size is perfect I got a medium and it fit just right. Don‚Äôt think about it just get it you will feel so sexy great for lingerie partying boyfriend or girl friend adventures just get it üòçüòçüòç

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Size medium says for A, B and C cups but it is DEFINITELY NOT. The top is not flattering at all and there‚Äôs no way to adjust it to fit better. For reference, I‚Äôm between an A and B. Nothing about this top fits right. Maybe the smaller smaller sized top would have fit better but then the rest would have been way too small. Bottom line, if ur not at LEAST a full B or C cup, don‚Äôt bother. The top won‚Äôt be flattering at all.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  nothing lined up correctly and even the cups are attached differently. It‚Äôs super poorly made and if you don‚Äôt mind the fact it looks like a toddler glued it together, you‚Äôd like this.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I really love the style, color, even the material, but the garment was already torn before wearing. I think I may be able to stitch a fix for a one time use, but I am so disappointed in the quality. I got neon green 2XL and my bra size is a 38D. Fits great!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am in love! Fits great and comfy and makes the butt pop!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is not made for those of us with modestly-sized breasts. I did not look sexy. Had to return

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered a large and probably could‚Äôve gotten away with a medium. It‚Äôs very stretchy and more of a supportive style bra. It‚Äôs not as tiny as most of the sets bras but what it makes up for in coverage, it has in sexy. The straps are all very expensive looking and the thigh garters help connect the middle piece down. It‚Äôs a very supportive style and could fit a bigger bust easily. I‚Äôm 36D and it had a lot of room for another cup or two if needed

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is true to size. You get all 4 pieces.I have ‚Äú love handles ‚Äú so of course the thing does not look good in my body type , so I just used another place lace panties that I had.But product is great not issues with it.All traps on the garment and bra are adjustable

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  A very cute and sexy skirt with a ton of potential, but it wouldn't even cover 1/2 of my wife's bottom even when she was standing straight.  She wanted super short, and is not shy, but there is just no way anyone could ever wear this except maybe over a bikini, which defeats the ""flirt"" purpose.  5'2""  with full hips, so got a size Large: Front length hits 1.5"" below crotch (okay), but the back would need another 4 inches just to reach down to a point that a full 1.5"" of cheek would show.  Unfortunately, we had to return it.

  Actually an impressive skirt, nice material. Other than a comment saying 'skirt fits as regular size' I didn't see a size chart per se, but i used my/the standard (US) size(s)... & its two thumbs up Perfect!!

  Love it! Fast shipping and looks just like the photo. I ordered a large. My husband loved it. Great buy, no need for spending too much for something that‚Äôs coming off. Save your coins and shop this vendor! 5‚Äô11 187lbs 34DD

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bra was a little too big (I am a 38 DDD), but manageable. Paired the undies with another pair of stockings from another seller on Amazon and they look great together! Size 16/18 5'9"" 250lbs

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was scared of the bralette part but it turned out to be the part of it I loved the most. Overall a great product would buy again

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I got a small. It‚Äôs too stretchy so l had to make a plan of pulling the straps at the back and make a knot to support my saggy girls. It‚Äôs a sexy set for a romantic night and pictures. For the price it‚Äôs worth it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm very petite and it‚Äôs pretty hard for me to find a garter belt that I fit in. Because they‚Äôre usually all too loose. But this fir me perfectly. Also the lingerie is really pretty. I went to a high end lingerie shop this weekend and thought everything was gorgeous but too expensive so I went home and bought this set and honestly I like it better than anything I tried on at the shop. The quality is really good especially for the price. It does seem a little delicate but all lace kinda is. All in all I‚Äôm super impressed and have no complaints. Also I‚Äôve seen some reviews that says it runs big and I just wanna say that‚Äôs not the case at all. Like I said, I‚Äôm pretty petite and small fit me perfectly.

  ¬†I threw a lingerie party for my birthday and I looked so pretty. Just a heads up, it‚Äôs crouchless, so I wasn‚Äôt doing much dancing lol but it‚Äôs so pretty!

  Luce bien, soy copa B y talla 9 en pantal√≥n y me quedo grande la talla XL, una talla L habr√≠a ajustado bien, la pinzas que sostienen las medias son de goma por lo cual son muy fr√°giles y terminan por romperse

  It looks great but the crotch of the underwear is just a string. Not well suited for anyone‚Äôs anatomy! The rest is super cute and fits great though!

  Did not fit my bust. Not enough material to hold breast.

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, 190 lbs and a size 36F. I was surprised at how well the bra fit despite most lingerie I buy being waaaaaay too small in the bust. Bought this for a boudoir shoot and it covers me in all the right places! Def  worth the purchase. I would size up so that you don‚Äôt have pinching and rolling - I bought a 2XL despite wearing an XL I regular clothes.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was skeptical about sizing due to the other reviews. I am 5‚Äô4, 160 and purchased a large. I could‚Äôve definitely used a medium and still been fine.This is super sexy... ladies you will set the tone with this one!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I NEVER leave reviews, EVER. But I just had too because maybe someone is like me and needs to hear this. I am 8 month pp with my first child and self love has been a struggle. Constantly feeling gross and just uncomfortable with my body and find it hard to put anything on let alone lingerie and feel good. I‚Äôve been wanting to do something nice for my man and to just show him a little bit of effort to make things fun for us because we haven‚Äôt gotten any time alone since the baby. I literally thought about canceling my order a million times because I just knew I was gonna hate the way it fit me because I‚Äôm not skinny like the ad pictured BUT BOY WAS I WRONG. I wear a size 10/12 in jeans, I weigh about 170, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4, I wear a 36DDD and putting this on literally brought me to tears because I just felt so good. It completely made my Fupa and side/back rolls disappear and I just felt sexy and instantly excited to get ready and show all this off to my man! I got the xxl because of the reviews I read and I‚Äôm not disappointed one bit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Purchased for plus size girlfriend. The 2x fit her fantastic. Eye candy for me. She has 18-20 pant size, 18-20 dress size, 46b bra size. Maybe that will help someone else out. Avidlove lingerie I'd the best a cheapest for the awesome quality.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I got an XL, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 180 lbs. C cup chest, big butt, fit great. Stays on. Probably could have gotten away with a large but it adjusts everywhere.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered two colors in xxxl. My VERY first thoughts upon opening were ‚Äúwow these colors are beautiful!‚Äù And ‚Äúoh my goodness they are soo soft‚Äù I love the size of the bottoms, I was actually most nervous about those not fitting. The quality is more than fantastic for the price point, this is a wonderful buy ladies. My only complain that the cut for the front lace of the thong is incredibly small for being a xxxl therefore I switched the underwear for the pictures.I am 5 foot 6 Inches, I typically wear a 38c, 36 waist, 44 hips.A size 00 shirt at torrid and size 16 jeans typically.I can wear size large Addidas tops And medium adidas joggers but had to order a xxxl.But I‚Äôm awkwardly shaped.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This was the second color purchased for my girlfriend. It is hard to find clothing that fits her, but no problems with this. Looks great (but she'd make anything look great).

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is a pretty sexy set! Quality is a little iffy but it‚Äôs not bad. (It reminds me of the kind of quality you get with some online costumes.) I had some troubles with the undies. The strings twirl on themselves so it takes patience to straighten them back out. The bra allows for spillage which I guess is a good thing if you have nice boobs- mine are a bit ehh after having a baby so I would have appreciated a bit more support. Overall I think it‚Äôs worth a try! Especially if you‚Äôre just wanting to dabble in lingerie and don‚Äôt want to spend a lot of money.

  No underwire so gave it away as a gift gift was loved

  Lace is extremely soft and the fit is flattering. I already ordered two more from this line and looking forward for them to come in. For reference I‚Äôm an 8 and wear between a M-L in most tops, 32 H or so in the busy and I‚Äôm in a large here.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Cannot love this any more than I do. Very well made. Super soft material, and incredibly flattering on. I am an A cup (5‚Äô5‚Äù 130 lbs) and usually have a hard time with lingerie, but I got a medium and it fits perfectly. The lace is super soft and stretchy so it should fit many bust sizes. The g-string it comes with fits surprisingly well which I was not expecting. Overall a great buy and would recommend it wholeheartedly.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5‚Äô7, 115 pounds, and I‚Äôm somewhere between a 32-34D cup (gotta love that half-size thing ü§£). anyway, I bought this in a size medium, and while it fits comfortably since its stretchy, I kind of wish I gone for a smaller size to make it more formfitting as it shows on the model. Still, it's very comfortable and pretty and it works great as a sexy nightgown.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Such a beautiful number! I feel very comfortable in this. The straps are adjustable. The color is gorgeous and I love how I feel in it. I definitely recommend!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So omggggggg, I love this it‚Äôs extremely sexy and flattering. It‚Äôs soft and so comfortable, I bought it for valentines day and I must say I am not disappointed!!! I would definitely buy it again maybe every color

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This thing is amazingly soft.  I went down a size from what the chart indicated I would need (based on another review my size) and the fit is perfect. With this garment the crucial measurement for a great fit is the bust of course. I'm a 34DD (39"") bust and the size large is perfect. Just enough stretch in the fit for some support but so comfy. The chart indicates i should wear an XL. It would have been too large.  because of a great review with measurements from someone else with my measurements i knew to size down - so thanks for that!!!If you are a little larger, say an inch or 2 - it would still be comfy in this size with the stretchiness, but unless you're short like i am (5' 1/2"") and can adjust the straps up a little, it might not contain the girls. Depends on your build. We're all so varied. But reviews with measurements help,  yes?soft enough to actually sleep in. Yay.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bought it as a gift for my sister-in-law's upcoming bridesmaid shower. Absolutely perfect and very soft. She's gonna love it!! Now I'm ordering one for meüòç...

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It fit as i hoped it would. The fabric feels amazing and not cheap like a lot of other similar products on here. Hugs my body in all the right places and is loose on the the not so right places.I‚Äôm 5 foot 6 and 170 pounds .Would definitely recommend

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fue un regalo para una despedida de soltera y nos gust√≥ bastante. La tela se sent√≠a s√∫per suave y se ve√≠a muy lindo puesto. Hubiera estado bien que hubiera talla XCH pero como quiera le qued√≥ bien a mi amiga la CH.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought one to see the quality and sizing fit.I typically wear a small but ordered a medium In case it fit right. In fact it fit a bit large.That being said, the colour is exact, the fabric, straps and embroidery are very nice. It is flattering and comfortable.I am returning the medium for a small and so far no problems in doing so.I will probably get other colours as well.Very happy with this purchase.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  bought it to spice the bedroom and  be more confident (self esteem)very niceit is light and thinyou have to be careful for not tear or make a hole

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love the colour (rose red) and the fit. I usually wear an 8 or 10 and am a 36d. Medium fits me perfectly with a little smugness in the breasts but works to advantage with design yo show them off. Very flattering cut.

  Excelente prenda, un regalo maravilloso. Sin duda es genial.

  Super cute and sexy but the white lace is really cheap and it‚Äôs extremely itchy. If the lace was of better quality, I would have given this 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è‚Äòs.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Perfect lil outfit

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I loved the look. I bought my own thigh high stockings. It‚Äôs a thumbs up for me.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fit perfectly!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Ok so the garter straps are attached to the apron, not the body suit which is already weird. And then those straps are very long and you can‚Äôt adjust them to make them shorter. Product fits but it‚Äôs just a little weird around the breast area, like the torso needs to be longer which is crazy because I‚Äôm only 4‚Äô9.  Can‚Äôt imagine how someone who‚Äôs taller would fit into this ‚Äúone size fits all.‚Äù I would not purchase again and this is WAY overpriced for the cheap, odd quality.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Garbage purchase! Do not buy! I tried this on and the strap broke in the process of me adjusting it. I will never purchase from this seller again!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  He loved it! It's like a thong leotard, with the apron. Which by the way, the apron is the part that has the garter strings that attach to the stockings so that was unexpected. Definitely not a one size fits most.. more like up to a medium. I'm 5'2"" and 160lbs and wear a 38DD, this fit but was really snug! (And kind of itchy) BUT it made me look and feel sooo SEXY!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  El producto es de excelente calidad; con el respaldo de la marca Dreamgirl.La diadema y la hechura es impecable. Le pongo 4 estrellas solamente porque las copas del busto son muuuy grandes. No parecen ""one size fits most"", estar√≠a bien que fuera sin copas. Fuera de eso es totalmente recomendable.

  Fits great. Boyfriend loves it

  Good fit and nice cut! I just wish the lace would be a little thicker so it doesn't bunch up at the sides.Update: I ordered 6 and returned all except the one I wore to try out which went into the garbage.The sides kept on bunching up and started to hurt from digging into my skin even though they were the right size and fit. I paid $12 for one of them and this is unacceptable for that price.I ordered Felina's lace thongs instead and the difference in quality is amazing! They don't bunch up at all and stay put all Day! I highly recommend buying those instead and they were cheaper too! Go figure!On my pic the red lace is Maidenform and the white is Felinas!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm between two sizes so I tried both, but the nature of the design meant they both fit with little noticeable difference.Anyway, I have a huge butt so any underwear I wear is gonna go up my butt. Consequently I always wear thongs because they're the most comfortable for me. I first got hooked on this lace design at Fredericks of Hollywood years ago, but all the stores near me shut down. I like how comfortable it is, and how slimming it looks.So I tried buying the same style from the subscription service MeUndies. They were nice but expensive, but for some reason not eligible for subscription, and practically NEVER in stock.Saw these on Amazon, tried them, loved them. As comfortable as the MeUndies. THEN I SAW YOU CAN GET THEM SUBSCRIBE N SAVE FOR HALF THE PRICE OF A MEUNDIES SUBSCRIPTION!I get one pair a month dirt cheap and I'm in heaven. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.I wash them in warm water in the washer along with my other darks, but then I separate them out and hang them up to dry so they last longer.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Thin lace moves around while wearing. Thin lace.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  First, the lace is of poor quality and the  height of the lace is a lot less than in others I‚Äôve purchased from Maidenform. Second, the cotton crotch is only one layer and is extremely thin. Lastly, the fit is not right.  I have always purchased small from Maidenform, but these fit much smaller and I have not gained weight!Very expensive in relation to everything I‚Äôve mentioned. These should either taken off the marked or priced under $1.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The sides rolled up as soon as I put it on and wouldn‚Äôt stay unrolled no matter what. I wore them once and the outside material started getting all weird like worn out Velcro.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Usually a bikini or hipster guy but this thong caught my eye. Normally wear a med/6 but an earlier experience with a thong made me size up to a large. Comfortable first thing in the morning but tends to slide down my hips as the day wears on. Lace around the legs were scratchy until I washed them, ok now. Not a lot of room in front for a guy so if you're packing may not fit. Really like the looks so may try a med. Wife won't wear thongs so these might just be for special occasions.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Holy crap, these really are amazing! I've never worn thongs before, because why would I want to walk around with a perpetual wedgie? I thought that people who say that you shouldn't feel like you're wearing anything if you're wearing the right thong have just gotten so used to them, but YOU CANNOT FEEL THESE. I've tried a couple other brands with good reviews, but they gave me that perpetual wedgie feeling.I'm blown away and am a convert. I'm getting more!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Well these were attractive, they don‚Äôt hold up. They sag at the crotch which causes them to go in places they are in design to do. Would not recommend nor buy them again.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Sizing is  large to that stated, would suggest future buyers go down a size, but lovely underwear

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Good value

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Looks n feels good. Been two wears an it feels like it‚Äôs lost elasticity though. Quick in quick out

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Seriously comfortable never wore thongs before this one and i can't feel it at all.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Feels like you're not even wearing it. Love it and will be buying more.

  I feel so comfortable and sexy

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this set a lot it‚Äôs my first lingerie cute, sexy , simple and really comfortable. My boyfriend loved it!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is super cute! It‚Äôs comfortable and the material is soft, doesn‚Äôt seem too flimsy. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 and weigh 155. I ordered a medium and it‚Äôs fit pretty well! I have a smaller chest and not a lot of curves but this set is still so flattering and so cute. I have been telling all my friends to get the same one!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bought this for a cute Halloween costume. It fit perfectly and was very comfortable. Some edges weren‚Äôt perfectly finished, and I had to cut a couple loose threads. But otherwise fantastic

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Usually I‚Äôm an xs or a small. I got a size small and it fits well. The bra & underwear straps are really stretchy and a little baggy when I lay down.Overall this set is perfect for photos and cute and pretty comfortable if you‚Äôre looking for something to take photos in.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This set was gorgeous. I‚Äôm not sure how to wear the garters so I don‚Äôt but it looks amazing without it. The top fit REALLY well, lots of stretch in the straps and band area below the boobs. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like is the underwear feel like they‚Äôre a size bigger? If that makes sense. So I don‚Äôt wear them. But they‚Äôre cute

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 140lbs, and wear a 34B and I ordered a Medium! The top fits just right, the bottoms could be a little more snug but they still fit! Super nice set for a great price!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It looks great on, but won't last long a long time. But if you want something to wear that will blow his socks off, this will do the trick!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very Sexy, bright colour. The bottom were too big for me needed adjusting. But overall very nice lingerie!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Loved these sets and so did my hubby, good quality and very sexy!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I felt so sexy in this and my partner loved it, the thong is very thin and definitely cuts you up a bit but to be fair, that doesn‚Äôt stay on too long once your partner see you in this, great value and the little heart details were so unbelievably cute! Very happy overall

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  What normally puts me off wearing lingerie is the discomfort. This set is incredibly sort and light with no wires or hard bits to poke at your skin. You could comfortably wear this set all day.I will say that if you have a larger chest and are looking for a good bit of support from your lingerie, this may not be the set for you. Similarly, the back clasps are not adjustable, so if you‚Äôre very very slim it may not fit well either (I normally wear a 36 bra band and it‚Äôs just about small enough for me - any larger and it would be too loose).

I originally tied the halter tighter to give the girls a boost, but it was more flattering to tie looser. The skirt portion barely covered my butt, which is not a complaint. The thong was way too big, but I hate thongs anyway and it was much sexier without. The choker was a tad loose, but I decided it was perfect to tuck the halter straps into so they weren‚Äôt visible. Overall, I‚Äôd recommend.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I looked like sex on a stick in this outfit. I‚Äôm surprised I‚Äôm not pregnant I looked that good in it and I got the best sex of my life. I got a medium I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 147 pounds and it fit perfectly

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I just love this! It looks and feels so sexy! And my guy loves it!225 lbs 5'7I think I ordered 3 x. Ill update if different when I re-check.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm usually a medium but I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and 147 with a soft mid section so im always worried about how these outfits will look and if they will make the wrong features pop. This outfit looks absolutely great! Very flattering in all the right places. I‚Äôm also super small chested and this made my chest look great. The thing is cheap and small but no big deal.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I wish I could give this more than 5 stars! I am a 14/16 and ordered a large and it fits like a sexy little glove! I could not be happier with this brand! I can't wait to order more! this set makes me feel so good about how I look and as a ""plus size"" woman, it's so nice to have such a quality set available that is affordable!

  Purchased this as birthday gift to myself and feeling like I needed to feel sexy again. Being plus size beauty now It is so difficult finding clothes but this item fit so well it even held my DDD breast nicely. Husband approved so I would definitely purchase again. Hope this helps my plus size ladies!

  This was super cute for a Peep shoot I did, very sheer but the strings have great stretch and hold up well - I got a Size Large : I'm 36-30-40

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super cute, I recommend this ü•∞

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It's too smallYou will need to order one or two sizes larger

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I loved this!! Wore it to the club for my besties birthday. Very comfortable, obviously sheer but rock with it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5.1 weigh 134 lbs. I got my set, in a large. The top fits amazing, but the bottoms are a bit small. I'm glad the bottoms tie at the hips. Other wise they wouldn't have fit. For lady's who have butt beware you will be eating the bottoms.Very pleased with the black set as well super cute.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This set is so cute! I ordered a large and the top fit perfectly, but the bottoms are soooo small! Since you can tie the the sides it can be worn as a thong, but I felt like it was supposed to be cheeky type underwear instead of a thong because that‚Äôs what the picture shows. Great purchase for the price though I‚Äôll still wear it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I don‚Äôt have large breasts but if they were they would not fit in a large size top. The material is not stretchy at all but oh so cute! It for me adorably but it did press down on my chest and that was a large, I typically wear a medium.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Overall a good purchase for the price. I'm very curvy and the elastic ties are accommodating to my hips. The top was a little loose on the bottom, but not terrible, my boobs aren't falling out. It's worth the money, durable, and cute.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Cutest outfit EVER. I wore this with hot pink suede boots as a stripper and I got so many compliments it's perfect! I could of gone up a size because I have broad shoulders so it's a bit tricky to get on/off but the bottoms are perfect. Im buying all the other colours!

  For the price I wasn‚Äôt expecting much BUT actually was very impressed with these lace thong panties. In all seriousness, these are basically the same as Victoria‚Äôs Secret and way cheaper. I have been a loyal VS customer for this exact type of panties but the amazon ones are a game changer for me.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These run ultra big, they‚Äôre ok if you‚Äôre into hiking them up to your belly and wedgies

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love these!! I usually buy from Victoria's Secret,but their prices are always high and not such great quality. These panties were cheaper and better quality. I put them on and fell in love! So happy!! Will be buying them again soon!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was so nervous about purchasing this underwear, because I am very sensitive to fabrics‚Ä¶ Without it telling me it was 100% cotton I was cynical‚Ä¶ But very pleased haven‚Äôt had any strange discharge or uncomfort, will purchase again very satisfied

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered Medium and received 3 Medium, 2 Small and 1 with no tag at all. No one checked the package when putting this together

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These are so comfortable!!! I own at least 4 or 5 packs of these and they are wonderful. I'm 5'6, between 135-140lbs and the small fits perfectly. They are very durable as I have washed them on hot and dried them on hi in the dryer with minimal wear. The sheer lace is very soft and stretchy, yet there is plenty of coverage right where you need it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5'4 and 220 lbs. Got an xl and it fits exactly as expected.  I love the colors. They look just like the pictures online. The lace is very dainty and it is a little cheap, but I mean for the price and what you get..pffftt Yeah...I will buy again. Arrived on time. Thank you!

  I‚Äôm always a size M in department store thongs & underwear and the size M was perfect and fit as expected. The quality is great too!

  Lol‚Ä¶ okay so.I‚Äôm a boudoir photographer and I buy items to fill my client closet.I took a chance on this item because it looked cute and was returnable. I ordered a 3x and it fit me perfectly. I am not a 3x in real life. I‚Äôm a size L or 12 pant with a 36DD chest.A 3x should fit a size 18/20 but this would most likely be wayyy too small. The quality isn‚Äôt bad, but it‚Äôs not a proper plus sized item. If you‚Äôre a size 16 or smaller it may work for you.Size 16/18(with smaller DD boobs) - order the 5xSize  12/14 - order a 3xSize 10 order the xl.I wish someone could actually make GOOD lingerie for plus size women.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I really like this idea and this piece could be stunning! With that said.. they still missed the mark. Interestingly, the waist fits. Its the cups that are wayyy off.I wear a 1x/2x and I bought a 3x to be safe (so I thought). I didnt read the reviews because plus sized women all have such different bodies and preferences. All beautiful too!!Anyway, the moment I pulled it out of the wrapping I knew this wouldn't work. Anytime the edges of the cups are connected and are supposed to fit large breasts, it generally doesn‚Äôt work. I still tried it on though. Waist fits fine and the design is beautiful. It wasn't completely terrible, but missed the mark. My boobs poured out of it.If you are marketing plus sized women, it is crucial that you do the research and design accordingly. It does nothing for self-esteem when it is already hard enough to find sexy-lingerie, then you buy something for plus-size.. and still doesn't fit.If this fits you, Im so happy! Hopefully you have someone special who recognizes your beauty and will love it when you walk out in it!

  I‚Äôm a squishy 34 year old mother of two with a mom belly‚Ä¶at 5‚Äô0 180 pounds it‚Äôs hard to feel confident in lingerie. I recently got a wild hair up my behind and decided I wanted to try to look sexy for my new skinny boyfriend (again, hard to feel confident next to a 125 pound guy when you‚Äôre my size) I wear high waisted skater skirts when I want to give the illusion that I have a smaller waist and those seem to do the trick‚Ä¶.when I saw this was pretty much the same thing just in lingerie, I bit the bullet‚Ä¶I‚Äôm so glad I did. I love it, I feel hot and my boyfriends jaw literally dropped. It‚Äôs fairly made and again, the most flattering lingerie for fluffy girls I‚Äôve ever owned. I wish I could find more like it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So when I opened the package I was pleasantly surprised  The lace and toolWas beautiful but I‚Äôm almost 37Just lost almost 200 lbs and breast fed babies so the girls need all the support they can get these days and any time I moved an inch theyWe‚Äôre falling out. I couldn‚Äôt get comfortable in it though when sitting stillLooked beautiful. I bought a pink version from a different company it was $5More and OMG so worth it  there was a LOTmore under bust lace and cradles the ta-tas and was so much more comfortable. Spend the extra $5And buy the other brand

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is ONLY for ladies with smaller tatas. I got a 5x (normaly a 3x because I was worried about my 40DD fitting and no it's soooo tiny does not fit the tatas not even half the nip. Super cute idea but it's not happening over here

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought 3x i usually wear 2x,or 3x. I love how it is not itchy. I love the silky feel to it. Boyfriend loved me wearing it. Made him smile so big . Kept telling me how gorgeous i look in it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I really liked how sexy this made me feel when I put it on. There‚Äôs a bra like closure in the back, and a little slide in clip for the skirt closure. I‚Äôm a huge fan except the sizing I think is inaccurate, and the boob section needs to be wider. Maybe I should have gotten a 3X so there was more material (lace covering my nips) like the photos, but I usually buy XL. It still fits but I may try to buy the 3X just to see if it fits better.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I read some of the reviews. I normally wear a 2x size 18 pants. Initially I was going to order 3x but after some reviews I decided to order the 5x instead and it fits PERFECTLY. Material is okay, but overall pleased. Also wear a 40DD  and the girls fit but just barely.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  i‚Äôm a size 18 in canada with 46DD this fit good but i sized up from my usual 1x to 5x like recommend By others lease could be better it kind of drives me crazy that there‚Äôs a seam right down the middle of that lace in the front. however that being said i love this and it made me feel very sexy 8 outta 10 could be better but for the price i‚Äôd def recommend

  I weigh 400+ Pounds and it fits and u am not busting through the seams. My husband loves these outfits.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was skeptical about ordering this because I didnt know how it would fit but it arrived after like 4 days and let me just say it fits perfect I looooove this I'm a size 2x to 3x and it fit me plus had extra room  in it as well...I ordered another type as well and it was a crotchless fishnet one piece and even tho I got in it, it was still very tight and it kept tearing so this product was definitely 5 stars compared to the other one .....hope this helps

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Honest review! I wear a size 24 pant and am 46ddd on top. The sleeves fit. The outfits fits.  It does have amazing stretch. I have piercings so this is not comfy but I don‚Äôt plan on wearing it long. Nor do I think it will hold up to multiple uses. I think it will suit its purpose and hope it is fully ripped off!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was so nervous when the package came because it looks like it will fit a size 2! I was wrong. This thing stretches and it looks so sexy. I‚Äôm a size 16/18 and 250lbs. I would say it would fit like one size bigger but anything more and it would probably rip. I don‚Äôt know how it will wash but the red made for a great time. :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 236 pounds and this lingerie is a perfect fit. It even sucked in my tummy a little.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So I decided to buy these after seeing reviews. Tired of looking at things that are super expensive just to wear in the bedroom because I'm a big girl. So taking them out of the package they looked like tiny panty hose and I was like omg  but I gave it a try and they're amazing. Of course they're a little fragile but I mean maybe you want it ripped offAnyway I'm 5'2 300lbs and they fit. My husband loves them

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm like 280-300 pounds & 5'5ish I guess, maybe 5'6. A lot of my weight in my freaking belly of course. So hesitant to buy stuff online but giiiirrrlllllll buy this. My belly hangs low (but not past my vag) but this keeps it covered for the most part unless I got my legs in the air.......youknowwhatimsaying. Big girls know how hard it is to cover that ish with crotchless stuff. So worth it & has stretch still.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm a super curvy size 12 pants, 38DD, big butt, very large thighs... and this fit so well. This normal size one actually fit very similar to the one I ordered that was plus size, they stretch A LOT.

  But this , it‚Äôs so sexy . Must have pasties

  The snaps make it easy. Doesn‚Äôt cover much but still very fun. Fit well. Would recommend.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love this product!! It fits great. The fishnet is pretty durable. I have caught it on a few things and luckily it did not tear. And it even glew in black light! Made my outfit look cool

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  saw some girl on the review lookin bomb af. I tried to recreate it and was not disappointed. I got complimented on my fishnets the entire night. 10/10 would recommend

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  For $10, this is a fantastic buy! I feel like Leelu from 5th Element or something. Sexy, stretchy, forgiving, comfortable! I will be careful with it, just in case it rips easily, but usually fishnet fabric is pretty durable. The hubs is a big fan! üòâüëçüèºüëçüèº(I usually wear size L in normal clothing and there is plenty of stretch left)

  I love it I got black and white

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5ft6in, 36D, 180lbs. I didn‚Äôt expect much when I ordered this fishnet bodysuit but it fits & looks great!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Partner loved it. He said that if he gave it a letter grade, it would be an ""O"" LOL. I loved it too. Very comfortable and flattering. I am 5'4, 120#, 34A. I am always looking for lingerie that works on women that don't have barely any boobs, and this looked awesome and made me feel confident. Super stretchy so I imagine it would flatter just about any body style. Just don't let it flip inside out, it's a pain to untangle, but, fishnet, so that's a given.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Far too small no good

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Its not that its small, its that its so scrunched up its impossible to get ""open"" without damaging the delicate strands

  Soooo much better than I even expected!!!!.. I could've gotten an XL instead XXL , next time, but I recently went from 175lbs to 215... Also I am 5'11 for reference sake. Not too roomy but could've taken them a tad smaller on the waist. Extremely comfortable and just goes over my belly button. Amazon ( Big ) girl approved!!!!... Length is good even for a tall girl even though I wish they were an in or 2 longer. Does not not make noise when you walk, even though my thighs are a lil big at the moment. Extremely soft lining in these pants!!!..so comfy! I'm definitely ordering the 2 pack in the future. I couldn't be happier with these!.. thanks!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not gonna lie, this made me nervous when I took it out of the bag. I wear a size 22 and ordered the 4XL, but once I shimmied into these bad boys, DAMN GINA!!!  I LOOK GOOD!  Super flattering with some compression for shape, fleeced line to keep warm, and they don't make any squeaky noises when you walk!! Winner! I don't feel at all like these are about to bust a seam or split on me, super comfortable leggings and SUPER SEXY!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I received my pants yesterday and had read up on reviews.  It did not have an odor as most had commented on ü§î that I was a bit skeptical on.  No problem there, thank goodness!  I ordered an XL thinking it would also run too small being it was skin fitted but I could have used a large but I will keep it for comfort purposes.  I like the matte finish rather than too much sheen.  I‚Äôd recommend this to the ladies out there!  Good buy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  As a mother of two with extreme body image issues, good leggings and tunic are wardrobe staples. I‚Äôve wanted leather-look leggings for years but have never pulled the trigger until now and I‚Äôm so glad I did. These are so soft, comfy and don‚Äôt make a weird sound when the chub rub hits when you walk. I have a large belly and an even larger derri√®re. You can‚Äôt see ANY cellulite and panty lines are minimal. There are only two negatives but it‚Äôs not enough to make me even consider returning them. They have a slight plastic odor, which I‚Äôm sure with a washing machine round of vinegar and baking soda it will be fine. The material isn‚Äôt breathable so they made my legs quite warm. I didn‚Äôt realize my legs were so hot until I took them off and I only had them on long enough to try them on and take a picture.For reference I‚Äôm:5‚Äô5‚Äù200 lbsSize 12 bottomsI purchased a Large and they are perfectly snug, just how I like them.I provided two pictures for reference, one with them on so you can see that they don‚Äôt really do any ‚Äútucking‚Äù on my belly but there is definitely smoothing. I pulled the legs up quite a bit but I‚Äôm someone with much longer legs may have trouble with the length being too short. The second is so you can see how much they stretched when I put them on.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5'6 and weigh 145.  Usually wear a size 8 pants.  Medium fit PERFECT.  Very tight, no weird bunching.  They are a tiny bit short but I think if I would have got a large they'd be longer just not a smooth looking.  I'll wear them with boots so I don't mind.  These are awesome.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These pants run very true to the measurements listed. I have a 27in waist and 40in hip/butt -- the small fit my waist perfectly, but is skin-tight in the hips/butt. The material is double lined (it's a soft, kind of fuzzy material on the inside), so even though it's very tight, nothing shows through. It's also very stretchy so you can move and kick around with no problem. I will say, when you first put on the pants, air does get trapped in the crotch area so you kind of have this air bubble until you start moving around.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I think I ordered the black shiny leggings.. Im 5'8, 113lbs, size 1-3 in juniors or 0-2 in womens..I wasn't sure since its a Chinese seller Bc their sizes are small.. But took a gamble got a small and I'm surprised it fits!.. It's not thin like most leggings, it's has a soft layer which keeps me warm.. it is high wasted, the texture of the material did kinda stick to the skin of my belly but I like that, it helped keep the leggings from sliding down like I have w some leggings.. So far I like it- good quality, it's versatile (can dress it up or dress it down) and not a bad price.. I took one star off Bc I'm 113lbs small hips and thin legs so it was a winsy bit baggy on the inner thigh area.. BTW it's not latex but that's how shiny it is..

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  First, I put them on and they fit. Cool. Second, my 3 year old asked me if I was a super hero (super super shinyyyy). Not cool. Third, if you enjoy sweating immediately like your in a sauna you will enjoy these. Not a fan. Lastly, you might want to keep some lubricant on hand while wearing them. Like the freakin‚Äô Tin Man from Wizard of Oz. So squeaky. Pretty much like the Spongebob episode where he gets new rubber boots and it annoys the hell out of everyone around him.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Way too short in length, material is cheap looking. Fit smaller than expected-it won‚Äôt even go over my thighs so it‚Äôs kind of a waste that I can‚Äôt wear them, plus the customer service from the seller was unacceptable-so rude.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Wow, I love them. So incredibly comfortable. I am concerned that I might poke my nails through the fabric so I‚Äôm very careful as to how I pull them on.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This item is terrible quality. Very cheap material and the material does indeed have a peculiar odor. I do not recommend it at all.

  I am 5'7"" and 185lbs...38 c and hips are 44 inches. The large fit me PERFECTLY and the pink is a super beautiful hot pink ...the underwear were a little big but whatever this was still one of the best purchases ever! Its stretchy too! GET THIS!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love love love! Super comfortably and fits great! I ordered a small. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and bra size is 32A but is stretchy material it‚Äôs not constricting

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very lovely. The tie around the neck really helped hold the ‚Äúgirls‚Äù up and in place. Used it for a boudoir photo shoot for my fianc√©. I‚Äôm fuller figured at 5‚Äô9‚Äù and 200ish lbs.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love love! It fit perfectly. As a smaller gal, I have so much trouble finding lingerie that fits me. Panties were a bit large, though.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Set was great, used for my maternity shoot and was not disappointed. Did not expect top to be see through though, that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs advertised in the pic

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Avidlove, is the BEST lingerie' on Amazon or in any department store! It's GREAT quality, looks FANTASTIC on, colors are ALWAYS TRUE to what is shown and ACTUALLY FITS!  It's never to small.  I am 5' 6"" / 165lb to 180lb depending on the time of the yearüôÑüòâ.  I wear USA sizes large & extra large or a 14-16 depending who makes the garment.  I purchase from Avidlove an XL-XXL and usually find that l could have gotten a size smaller.  Like a regular large would work fine. However, due to weight fluctuations and sometimes a little naughty play, I want the extra wiggle roomüòâ! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My favorite part of this set is the bottoms. A lot of them come with g strings, which are a bit boring to me. These feel super sexy and fit just right. The top is very see through which could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on what you like. It is made of good quality materials. The ribbon that goes around your neck is very soft and luxurious. It is not uncomfortable at all. I feel like it's not the best for small chested woman, but overall I like it. I'm 5'4, 110 lbs, 32B for reference and wearing removable pads/underwear for the pictures.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm about 5'2, and wear a 36D bra size. I ordered the rose pink color in a size large, and it fit perfectly! It was a liiiittle small on the bust area, but not small enough that I spilled out. It has some good stretch to it, so that's a plus. Perfect length as well, and accentuated my short legs nicely. It's suuuper comfy and the material's great as well! Boyfriend loved it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  true to size, I have slightly wide hips and 38D chest, I am about 5' 7 and 170lbs. My bust is 106cm, and hips 107 cm, I ordered an XL and its perfect. Not too lose or too tight. Its comfortable, nice and soft material as well. Boyfriend loves it, good price for what you get. Would definitely recommend!

  I can see why this teddy has 5 stars. Not only am I a long torsoed woman of 130lbs and 5‚Äô8, so for me I have been on and off again life long mission to find the perfect fit one piece lingerie. The lingerie fit perfect because there are places you can tie it, to where it will better fit your body. Only down side is that you will not be getting support for your boobs and luckily mine are not saggy and I can get away with it. Only fixable issue is that the butt area was tied the opposite way of the picture, but not gonna take a star off for something a pair of tweezers and a couple minutes can fix

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very Sexy, perfect fit. üòç

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very flattering. Absolutely love üñ§I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù, 135 lbs and a size 36B. I purchased a size small and it fits perfectly. The adjustable straps are great, especially if you have a petite frame.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This lingerie is amazing. It worked so good for my boudoir shoot!You'll definitely feel sexy in it.It fit great, was slightly loose in the breast area but other than that was great. The color was super flattering and looked just like the photo.Would definitely recommend!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Really beautiful feminine teddy. It made me feel sexy. I got it in white. Husband loves it. Great detail in the back with the strings made it even sexier. Can‚Äôt wait to wear it again. The small fit me fine. With the strings it‚Äôs easy to adjust. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and 110lbs

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Comfortable, I feel so sexy in this outfit üíï

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I never write reviews but felt like this item was worthwhile, especially to help out my fellow tall girls out there. For reference, I am 5' 11"" with a long torso. I was hesitant to order something like this being that one piece anything rarely works out for me but this item fits beautifully! The straps are adjustable making the fit extremely doable. I ordered a size medium and it's perfect all the way around, and the quality is great for the price. Love this!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This really looks amazing on! I bought the navy in a sz med. I‚Äôm 36D, 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 138. I def don‚Äôt have a body like the model but I will tell you, it hides flaws! I‚Äôm sorta boxy shaped and it gives me a waist and makes my flatish butt look good. The only down side is the material. It isn‚Äôt very soft but honestly, it‚Äôs all about the visual. It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôll be sleeping in it :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So pretty! I got this for our anniversary and my husband loved it! The only thing is it doesn‚Äôt have snaps on the bottom! Wish it did wold have made it better I think!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Los good but had to take out ribbon in the back. No way once tied up would get off without ripping. Still looks good tho just had to modify i am very small too

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Go for one size bigger than your actual size, I got XL just to make sure but still gorgeous! He loves it on me!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Cute but not good quality won‚Äôt last long

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love it

  I am 5 foot 7 and 1/2 and 190 pounds and outfit looked great.  Allow for 30-45 minutes to figure out how to put it on.  Challenging!  Love it though. Step through dress first then put feet in.  Make sure  stockings don't twist!!!! Put G string on first if you are going too cause you are not going to be able to take this off and on easily unless you are very coordinated and patient.  G string not included.  I didn't wear one.  Make sit easy to use bathroom.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So disappointed, didn't even get to wear this as intended. Just trying it on it ripped & ran multiple times. I was careful/gentle too! With that being said, forget any throws of even light ""passion"" - this outfit would likely be in shreds.  Still giving two stars because it is cute, however, it runs very big. Usually ""one size"" fits just about right, but this could've easily fit a 6ft tall lady with curves. Item description says up to 160lbs for this piece & up to 240 for the queen size. I ordered/rec'd one size, but it could have easily accommodated the queen sized parameters as well.  Would not recommend or purchase again.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It is made out of swimsuit material so higher quality than most items like this, but I am 5' 4"" and 125 lbs and this was made for a woman at least 6-8 inches taller.  The thigh highs and the skirt overlap with a lose string hanging awkwardly.  If I spread the top and bottoms apart so the string holding them together is straight, the tights are at my knees or the skirt is above my butt.  Sent it back.  Too bad because it is so well made.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  First things first this is so dang sexy once you get it on. Bam.Ok. The material is a nice thicker nylon type feel. The dress and hose are both same material. It's so nice feeling on your body. Not a cheap itchy kinda lingerie piece. And I love the way it feels and looks on me. My husband well he couldn't keep his hands off me. I have a lot 40-50 different pieces of lingerie and this has been his most requested ever hee just keeps asking for it. So imma have to order a 2nd.. 22 years. Don't worry about the fit. It's going to look great and hug the curves head to toe.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5'5"", 42DDD and weigh 210 lbs. I purchased the One Size and it fits like a glove from head to toe!! I absolutely love it!It was easy to put on. It did not snag it. The material is quite sturdy, almost bathing suit material. Very nice quality.Only negative thing is that mine was not like the photo. Mine has the slits on the back of the stockings, not on the front. But it still looks hot! And I love it so much, I bought a second one. The second one has slits in the front as shown. I love them both!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love this outfit. Material is very stretchy and flattering. I'm short and curvy. Large boobs,mom tummy,and big rump. Be mindful when putting it on- sit down lol and it isn't that hard. Super sexy!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Material is not like swimsuit material. More like nylon material - you know, when we used to wear nylons on our legs! And it runs like nylons. Just when I tried it on, not because of my fault, it just started to run in 2 parts of one of the legs. No good. Cheap.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Firs very well. As good as the quality could be for that item and price. I‚Äôm a curvy small-medium and it fits well but could be a little tighter for my liking. Nothing to complain!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This product is a must get. I love it, sexy and soft. I need more colors.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'5 110lbs and this fit more like a tank top than dress

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not much to say....very kinky, good qualiy for stuff in a box,  Dreamgirl!

  Love love love! Super stretchy and comfortable. I was skeptical bc this product seemed too good to be true (regarding the quality & quantity for the price) the fabric is soft, thick, & stretchy. Very flattering on. I am so glad I made this purchase - Def recommend!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These fit great! I have thick thighs and wear size 14 jeans and had no trouble with these!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super sexy I just tried one on and in 5'6 at 190lbs and they worked with my thunder thighs quite nicely üëå

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Seriously sexy! I‚Äôm five foot two, 145 pounds, size 10/12 and the XL fit perfect!

  Im not gone lie to ya at all this is it... had me ready to rip them off.. had the booty sitting just right and the open slots ....üôèüèºüôèüèºüôèüèº Best gift i got shorty

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5‚Äô4 And 145 lb. I love these! They feel cozy and stretchy. The way they stay on is amazing. Not too tight. My hubby loves them on me!! So night not to have to mess with garter attachments. Worth the $15 for 5!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Was supposed to be assortedGot 5 of the same ones. Who needs five of the same ones?

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So these are pretty flattering. They look good on the leg, fit comfortably and are sexy, HOWEVER. They do that weird tent thing from toe to ankle. They‚Äôre not form fitting to my foot. I feel stupid wearing them unless it‚Äôs in boots where you can‚Äôt see the weird stretch. I mean.. the price is halfway decent regardless but I am disappointed. I had plans for these on an upcoming date and I most certainly won‚Äôt be using them for that now.In the picture I was wearing pantyhose under the fishnets, just FYI

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Realmente ,son pantiligueros ,muy bonitos y sexies  pero un poco grande, si eres mujer peque√±a puede quedarte muuy grande

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The product is made very cheaply The material stretches and the tip part slipped down  . Its made from a cotton material I think..

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits well but a little tight at the top of the stocking (where the thigh is) theyre super cute n sexy though !!

  LOVE! Smooths out tummy great as well as hiding it and flatters curves so well! i will for sure order another one it is so sexy and soft and very stretchy! if you are thinking about buying it trust me its worth it! im 230 lbs 5‚Äô5 but my stomach is small for my size

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I loved it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love it. As a girl with a belly I was kind of nervous about if I'd look like a busted can of biscuits in this boy was I wrong!! Looks an feels great I will say with if you wear a Womens 14 I would go with an XL just because YES it does strech buttttt not a lot. I myself am I between an 12 an 14 depending on the brand an I got a L but XL mite have been just a little better but the L still looked great! If anything the L helped ""the girls"" perk up. An that's another thing I'm a 38 DDD/F and it worked perfect the V pattern an the halter string help the perk up. Hope this helps

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 205lbs and this stretches to fit my curves and my thick figure. I like it a lot. At first It looks small but, ‚Äúgirls it will fit just about anyone‚Äù.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Sexy lingerie even for plus size ladies. I'm a 20-22 and bought the 22 it's a little snug getting it on but very cute. Will buy other colors

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was a lil worried pulling it.out of the pkg it looked way to small ...but after putting it on DAMN I was feeling it. I didn't look like a busted can of biscuits...I was looking GOOD!!!!!! I did go up a size I'm normally and XL and I got a XXL!!!! Big girls BUY this you won't be disappointed I promise!!!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Looks just like the picture and good quality. Did not tear when I put it on. I just don‚Äôt have the figure for it.

  Loved it . So did my honey bun ;)The halter part is a bit funny fitting but still nice

  Doesn‚Äôt worth the money

  I'm larger on top and smaller in my waist and hips. I am 5'6"", 125 lb, 32DD, 26"" waist, 36"" hips. I got a medium and it was slightly loose in my torso, but still fit. It was a little too small on top, so I will try wearing it with a bra underneath. The material is soft and the eyelash lace looks nice and not cheap looking.  The cups look as though they have a wire, but this bodysuit does not have wired cups.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am never one to expect that a top will fit well. I am usually a 36 D and I don‚Äôt love spaghetti strap tops. I will say, this one is a comfortable feel and it gives just enough sex appeal that my night ended in a proposal! I ordered a large to make sure I could adjust myself and I definitely had to make the straps tighter to keep me afloat.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love how this piece fits.  It stretches where you want it to and stays tight where it should. It is actually great for wearing as a top with a cute skirt or jeans. I am 5-5 and weigh 160 and bought a large.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It's Amazon lingerie, so I can't really be upset, but just know that you couldn't wear it how they have it styled in the photo. It's entirely cotton, so there's no real support. It looks like there is underwire in the photos and there isn't. You could probably find something better, for comparable price.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits true to size.Super comfortable/ stretchy.I‚Äôve washed & air dried it & it still works great!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I have extremely mixed feelings about this top. I feel like the photos looked better than it did in person. (I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm gross and had a pimple on my back I‚Äôm human)I ended up returning, which is disappointing because I was so excited for this. I purchased this to wear out on my 21st birthday. The material felt like it might just fall apart when taking on and off every time. I was so scared of it falling apart I hardly tried it on. I normally wear a small/medium in body suits and I ordered this is a small. It was still too loose and not snug enough. NOT something I could wear out. I‚Äôm not overly modest. I just physically felt like I couldn‚Äôt move AT ALL without something coming out. I‚Äôm not sure if this is because it wasn‚Äôt as fitted as I could normally like or because of the cheaply fabric but there was no way I could wear it.The front is pretty regardless. Although no underwire and NO boob support. I normallyDon‚Äôt mind that but this top just didn‚Äôt cup my chest at all.The back mesh is hideous. Extremely resembles a fishing net or one of the stoppers in the old crime shows. My boyfriend even said it was so tacky he hated the back so much he didn‚Äôt care how pretty the front was.I was so excited for this, I wish it would have worked out!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Wore for a vegas trip with a cheap amazon skirt. Ultimately a great quality and held up fine. I recommend wearing pasties to avoid any lingering stares. Larger chest and small waist, I went with a size up from my normal.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This a must buy! Nice material...not itchy! Was extra careful putting it on because of the length of my nails. I‚Äôm a size 14, 5‚Äô5, 206 lbs & very curvy. I ordered an XXL because I‚Äôm not really a fan of bodysuits & I was worried about it being uncomfortable & fitting like a thong when it‚Äôs not one. This was super comfy & just the right amount of ‚Äúrisky‚Äù! Keeping it sophisticated, but sexy! It paired well with jeans, a short jacket & stilettos!Next color...the blush pink for sure!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is an oddly shaped product with no actual underwire in the bra area either. The snaps in the crotch area hang as well. Overall very disappointing, because it looks beautiful.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits true to size. Nice quality. Boobs actually fit in bra outline (small sizes sometimes assume you have A cups. I am a C and the Medium is great).

  The fabric is sooo comfortable and the color is extremely rich. My boyfriend loves when I wear this piece. Sometimes I'm a little self conscious of my tummy area (like most people here), but this forgiving while still being alluring. A definite must-add to your lingerie collection!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I always order large or extra large because i am every bit of my huge breast measurements for my top are under bust is exactly 35.5. Inches and peak bust is 44.5 inches which if i can find a bra in the correct size is 34 H or G or 36H or. G BUT THATS WISHFUL THINKING,  SO i ordered this in a large and the panties fit perfect and so does the top which is very shocking  because normally large bottoms are to big with a large top in a set because i usually buy my panties in a large 7 or 8 or most of the time a meduim size from target. This set feels great its so soft and the paties do not roll, sage or bunch up they fit just LIKE the model photograghed online. I am vert impressed and i will most definitely be buying more from this company. And so will my husband because these he really likes on me... .

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was a little skeptical at first, Im a bigger girl and to put it plain and simple almost everything i order online doesnt fit. But this,oh this is beautiful. It fits PERFECT so soft, made very very well the quaility is awesome and i feel so sexy wearing it. The color seemed a little off but i can push my OCD to the side to enjoy the nights i put this on.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Arrived a few days earlier than expected, the color is nice it's more of a light blue than a sea foam green depending on lighting. The material is also soft ,it does fit a tad big but it's nothing a quick normal wash and dry can't fix. I'm about 5'8 145 lbs, 36 C. I could have ordered a small if I wanted a tighter fit I can stretch the top a good 3 inches from my ribs before washing. I suggest delicate cycle if you don't want it to shrink. Very satisfied with my purchases from Avidlove so far. :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This babydoll is so cute and sexy! Fits really well, I wear a size 16 pants and usually an XL-2X top and the XXL fit perfect! For the price you cannot beat this babydoll, I honestly want to buy another in a different color.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love it! The rose color is darling and fits well. I'm a little chubby, 170 pounds, wear 38D size. I normally wear large t-shirts, but I ordered a XL. The lace bra top and panties fit perfect, only had to adjust the straps for support.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered a large.  I'm 5'3 & 155 lbs. Loved that you could adjust the straps which helped lift the ""girls"" & made them look full and perky. I have a big booty and the panties fit well.  My bf loved it!! I think it took me longer to put it on than it took him to take it off,  lol.  Loved the price and was delivered sooner than the date given.  Great purchase!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My man started drooling when I came out wearing this. Fits perfectly and gives a nice little tease show in the back.

  My wife tried this on and instantly asked me to clip the tags off, before even looking in the mirror or trying on a top over it. She's been looking for a good racerback bra to wear with racerback tank tops, and this one was an instant favorite for fit, shape and secure full coverage.She's 5'7"", 151 lbs, 36DD, 40-29-40, 55 years old. The band is non-adjustable but has some stretch, and she liked the fit. Her underbust / band size, measured without a bra on, is 32.5"".You can see from the first photo that there's no gapping with the straps, unlike even her favorite standard bra. There's also no push-up effect, but it does have a plunging design that can support deep V-neck tops and dresses. The bra conforms well to her natural shape, but there's less forward projection than with some other bras. The bra is nice enough to wear with a dress, while still being secure and supportive enough for athletic activity. The second photo shows the bra under a stretch tank top.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This bra has good support and just enough padding to keep everything smooth underneath clingy t-shirts. The front clasp is easy to work and the cut is perfect for tanks and other sleeveless attire. It's well made and the underwire channel is solidly constructed; I don't see it ripping or tearing for the dreaded exposed wire. I really like this bra in terms of comfort and construction.Here's the problem: The fit is really off. I am a standard 38D in just about every bra brand, and that's not a loose 38--it's a 38 at the tightest hook; I'm probably between a 36 and a 38. The 38 band in this bra is SNUG. If you're on the loose end of a 38, definitely size up a band or two.Second, I am a standard D cup in most bra brands‚Äîno spillage. I sized up to a 38DD because of the shape of the cup and the comments of another reviewer. Even in a DD cup, there is a LOT of spillage. I loosened the straps to the longest length to relieve some of the overflow and decrease the pushup effect, which I absolutely don't want or need, and that helped quite a bit, but there's still overflow to the point of near uniboob effect. I'm keeping the bra because I can make it work and I won't wear it with deeper cut tops, and I really wanted a black bra to wear with my tank tops and dresses. But be aware that you will need to size up, at least if you are in the larger cup sizes. And definitely watch your band size carefully or it will be uncomfortably snug and there is no adjusting that with a front closure bra.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is the most comfortable regular bra I have ever put on. It's perfect. I was worried about the racerback straps hurting my neck muscles like some racerback sports bras I've worn, but they are cut just right. They don't put any pressure on my neck at all! I don't feel constricted by it either.Also, whatever band size you are, size up. I was skeptical, but so many reviews advised it I just went for it. I'm so glad I did, it's a PERFECT fit. If I had gone with my regular band size, it would have been tight. Remember,  cup size is relative to band size, so whatever cup size you are, you are a size smaller when you go up a band size. For example, I am a 34DD, and ordered a 36D and it's just right.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My problems before this bra:narrow shoulders, sore back, trigger finger (yes really - tendon related), beginning to get difficult to connect back closing bras.IF you are going from a back closing bra to a T-back or Racer back bra then you will probably need to change size as well.I was a 34D. I fit this as a 34DD.If your band size is comfortable at the smallest length,(the closure furthest in leaving 2 hanging over (not used)) then stick with your current band size. IF you are on the last eyelet with no room to expand go up another band size.If you fit well at D then go up to DD. Hope that helps. If you're use to racer backs and know your size with them then stick with it.It has a thin pad layer for no grocery store freezer mishaps. ;0This is my Favorite bra!!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I wore this bra one time. I was at a fair with lots of people around, and ten minutes in, the freaking bra snapped! It snapped at the front clasp so I had to walk around the fair the rest of day with my arms crossed. Very disappointed.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  After reading all the good reviews on this bra, I decided to try one. Sure enough, it's very comfortable.Fits me perfectly. The racerback, but embellished design makes it look great from all angles. Trusted brand, too.I wore this under a partially see-through black bodycon dress on a date with an old work acquaintance. However,late that afternoon before the date, I was having second thoughts about the bra. Its clasp is made of thin plastic.But, as comfortable as this bra is, I decided just not to worry about it. Around 7PM things somehow got a littletoo boring for the gentleman, a retired engineer, and he was falling asleep. So, I pulled the dress down a little bit to get his thoughts about the clasp thinking this would definitely wake him up. He exclaimed ""It won't last the night!"" and then promptly fell soundly asleep. Other tactics got him roused, but the bra stayed on the entire date. He was wrong. I took the photo with me in it a few minutes before midnight, after he took me home. It shows that the clasp held despite my fears. I'm small busted, so I'm not sure how the plastic would hold up for a woman with the typically larger bust. But, given the relatively low cost and all the other good things about it -for mepersonally, it's 5 stars.  I'm 5'7"", 140, 36B.-Sina

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was not happy that this bra arrived with dirty marks on it.  I finally decided I would wash it rather than return it so I hope the marks will come off.  I was very glad to find this as I have purchased similar ones in the US but find front opening bras difficult to obtain in the UK.  Not sure why as they make much more sense!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Im a standard 34B and this is far too small.No where near true to size and is not fitting around my bak,. very strange back.  Requested return but  postage costs more than garent, total waste of money.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Sizing is completely off, comes from America so postage is expensive if you want to return.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fabulously comfortable - only issue is the ribbon holding the fastening clasp in place isn't as good as it should be. Needs to be re-assessed by manufacturer.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits much better than I expected (from previous experience of front-fastening bras). The catch takes a bit of getting used to, but once you've got it, it's easy.

  I got a medium. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 150lbs 38B and this is really cute. I love the bow. It‚Äôs comfortable.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is a cute fuchsia colored lingerie! I usually order a size small in lingerie but I went off the manufactures size chart and ordered a size medium. The size medium fits me perfectly an exception to the G string which is too small. I wish they added more length so that it could fit comfortably around my hips. I love the soft smooth ribbon and overall design of this lingerie piece. This is a fun little date night treat!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love avid love. It‚Äôs definitely my favorite seller to get fast outfits from through Amazon. It‚Äôs good quality and looks soo cute. Just as pictures and easy to put on. It‚Äôs short so this is probably best for someone with a shorter torso I‚Äôm plus size and 4‚Äô11‚Äù and this fits me with no issues. Will definitely be continuing getting stuff from this seller. I would post a pic but of me in it but it‚Äôs a little to sheer for me to show here.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This lingerie piece is GORGEOUS!!! The color is beautiful and the material is comfortable. The only thing I‚Äôm struggling with is creating a perfect bow (but that‚Äôs just me not knowing how lol) I also thought it would fit awkward since I do not have a big ‚Äútop‚Äù but the ribbon allows you to adjust it to fit just right

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this cute little lingerie set. The front bow is just as advertised and is very sexy. It fits well and most importantly my boyfriend loves it. It‚Äôs a lot shorter than I expected, but that‚Äôs okay.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Beautiful fit. Beautiful color. My husband is going to love this on me.ü•∞

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is a unique item. It just didnt look good on me like I wanted but it probably will for large breasted women. Using the strips to make a bow just didnt give me the look I was going for.The straps can be adjusted in the back. The lace is beautiful.  The Gstring is sheer.I got the large which fits well,  and I'm 5'9"" 170 lbs. I wear size 12 in dresses, shirts, and pants.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is one of my favorite lingerie! The blue color is attractive either in the morning or night and it compliments the chest area well! What I love the most is the amount of material to tie the chest area like a present. I also love the feeling putting this on and it feels so good against my skin. The small size worked best for me. It is quite flexible. My chest measurement was 36c.

  I wanted to do a boudoir photo session for my hubby so I thought you'd would be cute! I'm 5'4 and 200pds and normally a large in everything but I thought I'd go up a size and now I wish I would've gone up another size. My boobs won't fall out of the sides but they do pop out a bit. The shorts fit as well but they are just a bit tight and ride up. The robe is nice and fits too but it doesn't have belt loops as stated in other reviews.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very cute set! I'm 5'5, 198lbs, size large. Shorts are pretty snug, like zero breathing room lol. The bralette fits perfectly. Love the robe, came with a tie but the ribe doesn't have any loops for the tie... that was disappointing.Very soft, silk like material, this green is beautiful! Will purchase again but a size larger than normal.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  In this set there are so many pieces you get your money's worth. The color was perfect for my skin tone and all the accessories were cute. The satin is thin and soft but doesn't collect static as you wear it. It has a silky texture on the skin and the lace and elastic trims are soft and comfortable. The bralet has adjustable straps and the piece along with the underwear has a lot of stretch. I ordered a size small and it was a little big, but not too bad. The underwear has no panty lining.... and the robe has no belt loops but other than that it was a fantastic buy. The shorts are high waisted and cheeky style. The fabric can be easily ironed on low setting. Fabric for shorts and robe are 90% Polyester and 10% Spandex. All edges are rolled hems finished with surging. You can machine wash it, but I suggest a gentle hand washing and hang drying. Made in China. Pretty good quality for a low price. I'll most likely order a few more in different colors!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was surprised how much I liked this! I didn‚Äôt expect much for the quality, but it‚Äôs silky and soft and sooo cute. It‚Äôs nice to lounge around in. The lace top fit me well, bottoms too (I ordered medium). The only minor complaint would be the odd bulge that the shorts tend to create at the front when your body is in a certain pose... it can look I guess a little unappealing for photos. But that‚Äôs about it, all else I love about this set!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Okay it‚Äôs cuteHowever everything fit except the shorts.Which I find interesting.The shorts are way too small they are like a size x-large I couldn‚Äôt get them to my knees and everything else I bought same size fits perfectly fine.They definitely did not size the shorts correctly I‚Äôm sad because this was for my bday gathering and I can‚Äôt even wear the shorts.Huge disappointment.If you are full figured I recommend going a couple sizes up because I went one size up and still the shorts only is entirely to small.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Item looks just like the picture. I ordered a small but it is still EXTREMELY too big! Ladies if your petite I‚Äôd advise you to gain weight or not order product lol. Other than the product being overly too big, it is perfect

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Definitely glad I read the reviews. You definitely want to size up or 2. I‚Äôm a large at 5‚Äô7 and 180lbs and the xxl fit perfect. Top is completely sheet but everything fit perfectly. Beautiful material. I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments. Love lounging around the house in this

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super pretty color and the medium fit perfect (: Robe is a little funny and the top is just a piece of lace with straps. Expected quality for only $23üëçüèª

  Gf came out in this , girls , treat yo man ,I couldn't retain myself LOL A+ from a happy husband

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This one went straight into the bin. Last time I buy clothes without free returns on here.

  It is loose and described size does not match.

  I bought this for a shoot and ended up mix matching for two different shoots. The bralette is to die for‚ÄîI‚Äôm just super flat ü•≤ Fair Warning to Phat Coochie Owners: this thong will just barely cover the vajeen. I had to be a bit more careful with my movements when I was wearing the thong half of the set in the second shoot lol. This set is still cute nonetheless.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Just buy it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I purchased the lingerie set and i think at the time it only had one review and no photos. I was a little nervous about purchasing it but decided to pull the trigger. It is one of my favorite pieces I ordered. Its super surprising how comfortable it is and the quality of the product. It is soft and the material is thick. Even the thongs that come with it are a thicker material (not the cheap string with a piece of cloth most lingerie sets come with... you know the ones.) I came back to order the white but It wouldn't be back in stock until after our little romantic trip away. I will probably still buy it later on. I was impressed. Its very delicate. Very sexy.Im a 36 C and ordered a large but I am pretty sure I could have gotten away with a medium for a little more... vavavoom.. I was worried about armpit rolls lol but I don't think it would be a problem.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super cute and I would love it but it came to me broken. The metal clip to attach the strap is missing in one side and there are no replacements. I‚Äôm a 34DD and the large fits me well, but fair warning there is NO support. Still one of the cutest bralettes ive tried.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Opened up the bag and noticed a strong soap smell or fragrance. Lingerie usually come with the manufacturer brand tag that you cut off but this one didn't have one. Not going to return it but have to give it 2 stars for the smell. Will just have to wash it since this looks and smells like someone might have worn it before and returned it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I don‚Äôt do reviews and this is the first I‚Äôve ever done for Amazon especially, but I couldn‚Äôt not. I slipped into this little number and felt so sexy I had to send pictures to my boyfriend even though I had been saving it for our vacation next week. I could wear these every day. Live in them forever. Wow üòç

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This was SO comfy. I was just a bit disappointed that I didn't feel as sexy in the lingerie as I was hoping. The entire piece is made of quality material and I really feel like this would last a long time and is very wearable underneath other clothing. I personally just didn't feel as sexy as I wanted since there wasn't much lift, and as a B cup I like a little assistance with the ladies. If you are comfortable in your skin, or are more well endowed then I really think that these are worth the purchase.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love the sky blue color and, like others have already said, it's surprisingly comfortable. I'm 5'4 140 34-D and the medium fits. I have a larger hip so I wish I could have gotten the large bottom. But still it works. Will probably order in other colors

  Soft, sexy and comfortable üíï

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It is soooo soft! When I bought it I was expecting for it to have the itchy lace that so often lines women's lingerie, but I was wrong! I will probably buy more in different colors. I will say that the breast area is tiny - mine are Cs, and this fits fine, (barely covering the nip but I want it that way)... so women with larger breasts be aware!I'm 5'4"", 250ish lbs size 16/18. Got the XL and it fits nicely, just long enough to cover the booty

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Beautiful color and super soft material. Great length as well. So many lingerie items are way too short, this actually covers my booty. The fit in the bust is a little odd. The cup portion seems a little small for the ""girls"" and doesn't hold them in place exactly right, but then it is very loose on the sides. Tightening the straps helped a bit. Over all it is very pretty and comfortable, my lady bits just don't always stay in place.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I LOVE this set! I got the dark blue. It fit true to size. I will definitely be ordering in other colors! Its just the right amount of sexy and comfortable! The material is so soft and its very flattering. I bought as something a little sexier than my normal big t shirts to wear to bed (especially when my Honey comes over) and its PERFECT because I wont sacrifice comfort for looks. My honey will see it for the first time tonight and I am looking forward to seeing his reaction. Should be good ;)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This arrived within two days. It looks like the photo, and has an extremely nice/comfortable material. I will say this is something you‚Äôd probably want to wear if you‚Äôre hanging around with your significant other, as women with a bigger bust may have a slip here or there. Women with smaller chests will fair just fine though. I am 5‚Äô9, 170 lbs and I got a medium and it fits perfectly.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Foeant hold up washed twice on gentle and the strap came off.disapointed!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is super cute and so comfortable to sleep in. It‚Äôs stretchy and super soft. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to fall in love with it, but now I wear it all the time to bed, just because it‚Äôs comfortable. I‚Äôll definitely be purchasing more.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Dislike, it appeared to be breast fitting which it is not. I prefer a drawstring or form fitting for my breast since I‚Äôm in my late 40‚Äôs. Very disappointed in this wear.

  I REALLLLLY wanted to love this and more than that, I wanted to be able to show it off to my husband who prefers my boobs out..... but nope. What I got is defective and I‚Äôm returning it. The lace isn‚Äôt centered in the front where it sits under the boobs and it looks stupid as hell. I‚Äôm considering buying it again in the next size up or maybe just getting something completely different. I‚Äôm 34DD 5‚Äô4‚Äù 165ish lbs.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 athletic-curvy build 34C and 145 pounds, I got the medium and it fits perfectly :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs a hit with my man. He can easily touch, grab and do other stuff without having to take them off.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The lace isn‚Äôt even aligned with the rest of the lingerie top and the bottom literally has a cheap plastic-like ribbon that doesn‚Äôt fold right so it looks weird.I usually give 2-3 stars if a product is horrible but this one has Poor quality and it smells so bad!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  She likes it, I liked it.. we got down to business.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  a sexy piece given the stylethe sewing and material were just not right. The top choker part had excess fabric on one side when the other side barely had any. The bottoms were so stringy, took them off once and they got twisted in knotsThe M fit me I'm generally a 34-36 around the back and the underwear stretches

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered the nice looking black and green one and it turned out to be just a plain dark green looks nothing like the picture and the bow looks like the ones they put on cars when you give a car as a gift. Also the panties are like a safty harness way to thick. So i guess you can say it sucks!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'1, 123 lbs, a cup. I got a small in the navy. I sooo wanted to like this. The top cute in person. But I'm an A cup and it just did not fit. The bottoms are really bad. The bow goes in the front but it would be so much better if it went on the back. The bottoms were so uncomfortable and just no.But the red cutout set was bomb. That one was 3/4 stars.

Although it‚Äôs very sexy, it doesn‚Äôt have hardly any coverage at the bottom. It‚Äôs very uncomfortable and slides right up in between. I‚Äôd say great for a boudoir session or to get naughty, but not for wearing in public or walking around. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm too tall and need a large? Who knows!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I took chances and bought some lingerie on Amazon.  Got tired of Victoria Secret prices.  I recently got a boob job and wanted to feel sexy post-surgery.  Out of the 6 different purchases I made by different sellers, this one was my favorite.  I purchased more.  Bought red, purple and black.  Sizing: (165lbs, 5'9"", 36D implants) bought a medium.  I have a tall, muscular build - I'm a professional athlete.  The design and fit are wonderful.  So attractive.  The lingerie made me look like the model in the photo. I couldn't believe it.  The only draw back is the material.  It's soft and it feels good.  But it doesn't have that ""thin as a whisper"" silky feeling that Victoria Secret's does.  It's worth the money I paid, though.  It might not feel like a $100 teddy.  But, that's ok.  I didn't pay $100.  And to be honest, when you are pulling on and off lingerie in a hurry - you don't want something that is so dainty that it's going to rip the first time.  I do not regret my purchase and I wish all other pieces were this awesome.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought this in the black and white for a boudoir photoshoot and they were perfect!I ordered them in a size medium. And for reference I‚Äôm 5.6 and 140lbs

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5‚Äô4, 197-200lbs 36DD and I got the XL and it fit amazing. It has a very high crotch area so if u dnt like That maybe this isn‚Äôt for u but it was very soft and wore it for a few hours with no problem. Snap enclosure is sturdy and the straps can be adjusted.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This feels like it's in between small/medium and even with it adjusted all the way its still a bit loose on the waist. The top doesn't look bad on small breasts if tightened all the way. I am 5'7"", 125 lbs, 32B, 26"" waist, 37"" hip. The torso was long enough (but it definitely scrunches up at the bottom looking like a front wedgie). It's Ok, many times these Amazon lingerie companies have a tough time figuring out the bra portion for size small. The weird part is that if u have small breasts, this set will make you're shape look like an inverted triangle even if thats not your shape.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this body suit! It fits so good and looks so sexy! It‚Äôs very flattering too

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The lace on this product is super soft and it's extremely cute in theory! In practice, it was just too big. I needed the sides to come in, so I adjusted the straps, but if you tighten them too much the front gets pulled over your shoulders and the whole thing looks weird and ill-fitting. For context, I'm about 5'5 and 110lbs.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The fabric was cheap, it did not hug my body well, & the boobs were small & completely unsupported. It fit really weird, like the body part was kinda loose, the boobs didn‚Äôt fit how or where they should have & had 0 support. I really hated it altogether.

  Very soft material, which I thought contained some spandex, but it does not. I am heavy on the top - this night gown would have been GREAT if It contained cups for support - it is too loose on top, letting my breast hand slightly :( I purchased an XLarge, but probably could have gotten away with a Large. But I do not think the Large would have solved the issue with my breast. I have decided not to re-purchase, but to search for a nightgown with spandex so it hugs alittle more on my body.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  FITS AND FEELS AMAZING. Super soft and very comfortable to sleep in.. but beware if you have nipple piercings and your boobs fall out over night, it does get caught.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5ft 1, 200lb i bout a 2x and it was form fittingso it runs small, i was hoping for a little looser fitlooked really nice, very soft fabric

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is the softest nightgown! I am a ‚Äúhot sleeper‚Äù and this modal fabric is perfect- feels like you‚Äôre wearing almost nothing! Lace is not itchy at all (something I have found in other similar items), and it washes well too! It is a little more form fitting than I had expected but so comfortable it‚Äôs ok! Would highly recommend!!

  This product is very comfortable, good quality, and true to size.I'm 5'6 and between 145 and150 lbs. I ordered a large because I wanted a roomy fit, which is what I got. A medium would actually fit more appropriately, but I like the extra room.That being said, I ordered 6 in black, and hope to order more, which will probably include some mediums.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Its amazing. Its made well can be worn as gown or sun dress. Shipping was fast. Will definitely  order again. For ref. I am 5'7 180 lbs and I ordered an XL

  My wife got this for my birthday and it was the best 37 seconds of 2020!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  DO NOT ORDER if you have a long torso. I'm 5'8"" and this was going straight up every crack and crevice. Maybe if you are short you won't have this problem. But to halter it around your neck the way it's supposed to, then snap the closures with a longer torso, expect it to go everywhere you don't want it to. Not sexy and defiantly not comfortable. Usually I'm better at reading reviews before ordering things, but I rushed it because of valentines day. I ordered the correct size (medium) I wasnt going to order a large because I have a small chest. Had this been longer, it would have fit perfect.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I found this to be quite nice! Bought as a gift to myself, fit snug, comfortable and very enticing! Even though I was alone..lol...I will admit, it took a minute or two to figures out the neck choker..I almost mistook it for straps! Lmbo..I can't say I flatter this garment very well, but as a work in progress, the sex drip is on the way! I would recommend this to everyone...I am 5""3, 138 lbs approx..and this was a small.Make it work for you ladies!! ü§ó

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am not sure how to write this review for this product. I ordered an XL. I am 195 pounds, 46"" hip and 38 C chest, thick thighs & hips.. with some extras ;) I LOVE the look and style of this teddy. This was my first one, but this style was extremely short in the torso when it comes up and around your neck. I read in some reviews this happened to them as well, but I didn't think it would be a problem since I am short. I was definitely wrong. The high-waisted hip cut detail on the sides is super high, in my opinion... but I received a lot of compliments on this. Very sexy all together. GREAT cut and detail on the butt area, really flattering I think. This alone, I gave 2 stars off rip. Tried to get in red but, boy that color is popular! Black was the ticket!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This was the 1st time I bought lingerie in years & honestly, I was prepared to just throw it out if it didn't work for me. To my surprise, it actually fit great! (For reference, I'm 5'1"", 125lbs, 36-30-40 & bought a M.) The waist line is very flattering, it wasn't itchy, & the lace was more durable than I anticipated (with other lace, I've had it rip as I put it on). The red is more of a bright red than dark red or maroon, just fyi. Personally, I could've used a little push up in the top, but was able to make it work with a sticky bra - I just stitched the top about a half inch up to conceal the bra. Overall, especially considering the price, I was very happy with it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super cute, I reordered after getting an XL that was too small. The XXL is great, except it came ripped already...

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I really wanted this to work! I ordered the purple‚Äîcolor was rich and beautiful, the lace was soft. But for me, it just isn‚Äôt long enough for my torso. I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù 180-185 lbs. I tried an XL and an XXL. The larger size was roomier in the waist but not any longer. I must just have a weirdly long torso because I can see from the reviews it fit other ladies with my height & weight. I think it‚Äôs really cute for the price if it works for you!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The lace seems very good quality and is soft and comfortable to wear. I was nervous to buy lingerie online but I'm glad I did! I'm 5'4"" 145lbs and 36B and the small fits me well.

  I love this so much I bought another color. It‚Äôs so nice to wear silk to bed. It doesn‚Äôt bunch up all night or twist around like a cotton tshirt would. Very flattering for various body types. I am a bit chunky with a gut thick thighs and big ole backside. I typically wear xl but ordered 2 xl to be safe and it fit perfectly. A bit stretchy too. I don‚Äôt recommend wearing panties with this or you will see the lines unless ur wearing a thong. Straps on the top are adjustable too. I personally hand washed mine bc I‚Äôm afraid it will ruin in the washer but it does say u can put them in the washer. I just like it so much I didn‚Äôt want it to get messed up lol!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I run really hot, and especially in the summer cannot stand any sort of suffocating pajamas. These are perfect for me, and really sexy too! Im 5'1, 153lbs and ordered a medium which fit perfectly. The bottoms do have a stretch waistband but fit with extra fabric on me. The top hangs nicely, and i like the adjustable straps on the back. This set is nice and cool for sleep, and the fabric breathes well. There were no loose threads or wonky stitching. Washing was easy, just threw it in with delicates and hung it to dry and had no issues.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love these pjs. A girlfriend gifted me a pair for xmas and ive been adding colors to my collection. I‚Äôm obsessed with satin pjs and between here and SHEIN my needs are met Everytime. Xl is perfect if you‚Äôre a 12-14.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The bottoms are one size smaller than the top. The xs top fits my 125lb petite frame just fine but the bottoms might as well be underwear. The material is super luxe, silky and delicious. I feel super feminine in it but wish the bottoms were more appropriate to walk around the house in.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This can be considered one of the most beautiful PJ my wife has. I picked wine red color, my wife looks really pretty in them. The back design is cute and the shorts are stylish as well. My wife said the PJ was comfortable, she liked them too.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I have been wanting to get a satin pajamas set for a long time and this met my expectations perfectly. Love the fit and soft feel of the material. Burgundy is very flattering!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very sexy lingerie pajama set.  The wife looks hot wearing them around the house.  But at the same time leaves things for the imagination.  Both my wife and I love them on those special nights.

  Very comfortable! True to size. Nice material.

  I thought, ""how hard can it be to figure out a pair of strappy panties?"" So naive. It seems ridiculous to have to include an instructional picture but you will need it. To figure out this underwear: Lay the underwear on the floor. Consider the only stitched part (the crotch) the top. Working down, flip the straps so the ones on top have the outside of the fabric facing you. Seriously they could've just added a few bits of stitching in key places to make them easier to untangle because I swear to you, you will never find more unnecessarily complicated piece of underwear. I give it 2 stars bc the bra is cute. I wanted a very sexy cutout piece (I don't intend to wear it with a bra underneath). That being said, I did have to stitch the X's in the middle so that they'd somewhat stay together, otherwise it just looks kinda dumb and like it's not fitting correctly. I also added stitching to the panties in points where the straps overlap; Once you actually put them on (and kudos to you if you manage it), they're quite flattering and pretty hot. Overall: I'd return this a million times over in a million lifetimes if I hadn't already tried it on, just because of the underwear alone. SELLER please just add just a little stitching because this is really the only reason why I won't recommend this product.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs super cute but WAAAAAAAAAAY TO SMALL I ORDERED IT IN A LARGE AND IT LOOKS LIKE A EXTRA SMALL

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I typically run like a C maybe D cup, I‚Äôm 5foot 8 and 160 lbs. I was so excited for this but there is NO support, my boob falls out on the bottom, it hardly covers my nipple and I have those pierced and I have to position it just perfectly to get it to even cover my bars, and then if I move around at all my nip slips out. No support, I don‚Äôt recommend it if you have C cups or bigger. Not to mention the underwear i could have hand made. It‚Äôs sloppy stitching, not worth the buy

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  okay first off, i bought both one size up and one size i normally wear. this product is TRUE TO SIZE. so get what you would normally get. second, i bought 2 colors, the burgandy and the blue. both true to the picture, but with a satin shine to it that i loved. three, yes the straps can be confusing for all of 3 seconds. i dont know why other people are having a hard time with it. it comes with ties on it to help you sort it out fast enough. fourth, it held up through a washing machine and dryer. the color as well as the material.for the price point, its amazing! you cant really lose.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 160 pounds, pretty buff, bought a large, it doesn‚Äôt cover everything perfectly but that‚Äôs the vibe I was goin for. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt get a medium. Looks just like the pic, definitely difficult to get the bottoms on but I mean come on, what do you expect when there‚Äôs that many straps!I would buy it again in other colors!Not sure on durability but I‚Äôm definitely gonna hand wash it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super sexy! It was sent with small ties on the sides of the bottoms to help orient how it went on which was helpful. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù, 125lbs, 34C, size 5 bottoms and it fit great. The top is a tiny bit small but I don‚Äôt mind.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  If puzzles turn you on than this is for you !! The bottoms are beyond difficult, we had to figure it out on a teddy bear and it took us almost an hour. They need to be sent on cardboard. However, very flattering. Great stretch

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I purchased this because in theory this was a hot item. I love lingerie but this was complicated (as far as the underwear) once I figured that out (lol) and put it on it was way too big. I'm slim but I'm thick in the hips and bottom. Small is always the size I wear. The underwear material is too loose so it doesn't grab the hips and it isn't much to cover in the first place so it needs to tighter straps. The bra is not fitting right either. I would like a refund but I'm sure you can't return this type of item. It would have been great because it looks good in the pictures. Win some and you lose some and this was a loss.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I loved

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My Bf choose this cause he said it was his fave out what I showed him. Love the top can‚Äôt figure out the bottoms! I better figure it out before he comes back from deployment!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Unfortunately I have the issue of being small on the bottom and large on top so this one size for both didn‚Äôt work for me. The top was too small and i couldn‚Äôt figure out the bottoms so it will go back :( ok quality and very cute though.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This set is awesome I am a 34DD 5'3 and about 150lbs and ordered the medium. The bra straps don't stay in place super well but most likely you won't be wearing it long anyway lol so I wouldn't recommend wearing it out and about! But the quality is good and my man loved it.

  Es desechable y de p√©sima calidad, no vale la pena gastar en esto.

"Hanes Women's Cotton Brief Underwear Multi-packs, Available in Regular and Plus Sizes (Colors May Vary)",4.4,41846,False,https://www.amazon.com//Hanes-Womens-Cotton-Briefs-Pack/dp/B000J407WI/ref=sr_1_54?crid=2HKWU10901ND2&keywords=sexy+lingerie&qid=1649384840&sprefix=sexy+lingerie&sr=8-54,Visit the Hanes Store, $6.59$6.59 - $30.38$30.38 ,"

  Both JMS and Hanes state on package 'wicks away moisture'.  The 'How Stuff Works' website- Which clothing materials reduce sweating states: ""The weave itself makes the material highly permeable. Many of these materials are also chemically treated so that moisture won't soak into it.""  I am 55 years old and in recent years this chemical was added to clothing.  Underwear prior was simply cotton which does moisture wick fine by itself.  There is enough cancers caused by chemical exposures.  Possibly gynecological cancers could increase from this chemical due to location on the body when worn.  I spoke to both companies when this new feature began and no results.  It is all about profit.  With profit - if enough customers complain there could be a change to offer untreated underwear.  Please call or email the companies.  Thank you.An update - I found underwear that is natural called Cottonique and like the product.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  According to other product reviews, many people have had problems ordering the correct size of these Hanes cotton panties.  After doing some comparison research, I discovered that the reason for the problems is the sizing chart beside this product on amazon.com is totally inaccurate.  I wear a (U.S.) size 16 or XL in slacks, tops and most clothing; the sizing chart gives the size for my hips' measurement as a Size 8 in the Hanes cotton panties.  I have been wearing size 10 Hanes cotton panties for several years and after reading all of the comments re:  the fit being too small, I disregarded the sizing chart and ordered my usual Size 10 in these cotton, non-stretch panties.  When they arrived, I washed them in hot water and dried them on regular setting (i.e.  hot).  After being machine washed and dried, the new size 10 Hanes cotton panties fit me perfectly.  There was no shrinkage compared to a pair that had not been washed yet and the Hanes size 10 was the exact same size as the National cotton panties size 8 and the Hanes size 10 that I had been wearing for several years.  Based on my experience I recommend that you order two sizes larger than what the sizing chart lists for your hip measurements.  (Note:  The fit at the waist and legs opening is not tight ordering two sizes larger, so if you prefer snug panties, I suggest that you order only one size larger than the sizing chart lists for your hip measurement.)  I gave the product (4) rather than (5) stars because I prefer the cotton fabric Hanes used in the past over the new ""plush"" fabric.  I have no idea why they label this fabric as plush but the texture is different than in the past but does not feel thick or plush to me.  I hope this review will help you in determining what size you should order in these Hanes cotton panties and you will have a better idea of the size differences between the Hanes and National cotton panties.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Got for my little sister.  She likes them, they fit very well. Great price and they do fit well.  She is a size XL, I got her a size 9 and they fit perfectly, so I would go down a size or two depending.  She weights 240,  5 4 tall.  Hope this helps!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  If you are looking for your standard cotton panty, these are very good.  The size is as expected.  The quality is god.  Good weight in the cotton.  I have washed and dried these many times and they wash very well.  No shrinking, which surprised me. A good value. I have always been pleased with Hanes products.  I rely on review to make my purchases.  If you find my review helpful, please click yes for me.  Thanks!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I have bought the Hanes brand many times over the years. I've always liked and trusted their product. But this time I am very surprised and disappointed to find that every time they come out of the dryer there are long threads hanging off the waist bands and wound around other items in the dryer. What a mess. They are also thinner than they used to be. maybe this was just a defective lot, but I think I will look at other brands for now.

  I noticed some reviews that these are very large sizing- I ordered one size down and found that I should have ordered my actual size. So if you know Hanes - know this is true to size for hands. The size different between 6 & 7 is substantial. Also these are not low rise briefs. Those would seem smaller and actually I prefer those but these are great quality - hold up after several washes. I am really happy to see all black 100% cotton underwear on amazon. Finally Hanes realizes some of us are not into the pastels and flowers...

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought these for my mummy and she loves them!! She is a size 14 and I bought her size 7 . A 6 could have fitted her but you know older ladies prefer looser fitting underwears so I. Bought what I think she would like.I plan to get her a couple more packs because I believe in wearing 100% cotton undies to combat heat and extra moisture around your private area which can lead to yeast infections and other problems. They are a thin set of underwear so if you prefer thicker then these aren't for you. The pack has more solid colors than pattern colors. The stitching was very well made and over all I am a happy buyer. I would insert pictures so you can see exactly how the set looks.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Year after year I have bought Hanes cotton briefs.  And, year after year the quality goes down.  This latest purchased arrived and the cotton in these Hanes briefs is close to tissue paper thinness.  I am disgusted at how Hanes has cheated their loyal buyers by this cheap quality cotton.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Have bought Hanes before and they were great as I'm sure these would be if the sizing was a little more accurate... these were MASSIVE, when I say massive, i mean I could pull them up to my armpits, which is not the desired look I was going for.... perhaps they might be useful if I was going hiking maybe and lacked pockets, or perhaps they may even be more useful around Christmas, but right now, unless I grow another 4 feet these are humongous.... Other than that... they're great! haha. I wish there was more consistency for sizes across the board. There once was a time where you could try things on and the sizes were rather universal.... now you have to try everything on.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Forgot these Hanes are American sizes, I ordered size 10 thinking British size so were far to big, but love the Hanes wear should have ordered size 6.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I have used this Brand and size for years but these are much thinner  then others I fave bought

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Have bought these before in the States and loved them- delighted to be able to buy them again in the UK.They last for ages!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  US sizing by the looks.

  It‚Äôs okay! Not my fave... not comfy at allI‚Äôm 5‚Äô1, 145lb and got a medium

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I read the reviews to make sure I got the right size. Got the lace top and pink shorts, super cute and fit just right. Material was a little cheap but if it‚Äôs not staying on very long it‚Äôs not a big deal.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  7/10 would buy again. I have a small chest and it made me look great! The shorts are also cute, but a little too big. My top needs to be stitched at the strap because it looks to have ripped away a little, and there are some loose strands. The shorts have a few faint black markings on the back that I hope will come out in the wash. If not, it‚Äôs hardly noticeable. I can‚Äôt complain too much. Overall, it‚Äôs adorable and worth the cheap price.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Was hoping that this would fit better than it does. I'm a size 0 and am pretty sure I'd need to be 3+ sizes bigger to look okay in this. Maybe if they offered an XS it would fit better

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love this set- the top isn‚Äôt tight like you‚Äôd expect, but very comfortable. The bottoms are verging on a little ‚Äúcamel-toe disaster‚Äù, but for a comfortable set the options are limited.For the price I don‚Äôt think you can do much better- the color is as advertised, and its well made enough that I don‚Äôt fear it ripping at the seams.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was excited to get this and it came out of the box already torn on the top. I would have given it a 4/5 if it wasn‚Äôt for that.I‚Äôll still wear it after I sew it and see how it goes but I wouldn‚Äôt buy again.‚Äî‚Äî update ‚Äî‚ÄîOriginally 3 stars, now 1.Just got it out of the dryer and it didn‚Äôt hold up. Didn‚Äôt last a week and there was no fixing it. Cheap material, DO NOT BUY!(Added 3 pictures)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I got the smallest size as I am 108lbs and 5‚Äô 5‚Äù. This thing was more like a size M. Cannot even wear it. Asked for a refund and they went back and forth and didn‚Äôt want it back and didn‚Äôt want to refund me completely. Wanted to charge return shipping for a product not properly sized. Have better customer service! They gave me a partial refund to keep it, just so that they could keep some of my money. Not great quality anyways if it did fit! I usually love my purchases on Amazon but this is NOT one of them.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The top was torn in several places at the seam upon opening.  Unusable. :( No way this would even make it through one wash cycle.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love how the size is a little more accurate I would say the xs fits more like a small.I wanted the bottom.to be more fitting to my body but apart from.that it is my favorite one out of the 3 I purchased.I would buy another colour in xxs this time if they have that option

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super cute and fits nicely. However the stitching looks rushed and wasn‚Äôt done with accuracy. But if things like that don‚Äôt bother you then order this set!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Se lo regale a mi esposa le gust√≥, est√° bien, la calidad es regular, pero la talla chica no es tan chica...

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fit as expected. Feels nice. Looks nice.

  Bastante decente

  I followed the sizing recommendation,  got this and the midnight/dark blue.  The sets fit true to pic and feel nice.The docked star is due to the dye.  Though the tag says you can wash them by machine I decided to hand wash each set separately before wearing them for the first time.The blue I washed in standard tap cold water, there was some color bleed but not more than I expected.  The red I washed in lukewarm water.  The color bleeding got profuse very quickly, especially after some light manipulation with detergent applied directly to fabric.  I was shocked, had I thrown these in the wash for the first time run they would have ruined everything else in the load.So my recommendation is if you get one of the colored sets wash them on hand the first two or three times, to let the color bleed work itself out.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I loved this set! The material is smooth and comfortable it fit perfectly, mainly because I‚Äôm tiny and I can never find XS, and I feel like a princess with these. I had always wore old shirts and sweats to sleep, this was a nice upgrade ;) very happy

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love it, feels soft and looks sexy, I recommend it üíØ %

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  LOVE this! So soft, light, and nicely made. The material is high quality and is loose but with a slight stretch making it very flattering. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù 130 lbs and a small fits perfect. The shorts are very short, and with the slit even more revealing, but nonetheless flattering. Boyfriend loved it. :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Good fit and the material is very comfortable.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Mama looking real good. Totally distracted in the mornings. She likes. I like, and recommend for all whose wives are sexy, especially if she enjoys teasing around the house. A great balance of comfortably and sex appeal. As a hard truth, these may not appeal to, or look appealing on, frumpy ladies who do not take care of themselves and dress accordingly day and night. But, if your wife had a banging body that yoga and sweat pants will not do justice to, then these are of good construction and nice materials. Durability TBD, but worth the cost even if these last a year with weekly use. Buy a whole set.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Gets worn to bed every night.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These are very flattering. I am a medium pear shape and it fits me well. The navy blue is beautiful and the fabric is shiny and soft. I think I will be buying a few more in different colours. I'm happy with this purchase

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Really happy with this pj set. It's really comfortable and soft. My hubby loves it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fabric is nice on the outsideMuch too large in the waist. I'm normally s/m. This fits like a over size large. But not quite xlThe Top is square with no shape.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Comfy and flattering. I will be buying another set in a different color because I like it so much.

  I love this!!! It doesn‚Äôt squeeze and cause you to look like a busted can of biscuits and the material is so soft. It doesn‚Äôt offer much support but since I have implants that doesn‚Äôt matter to me. My husband loves the way the straps above the breasts look. It was a complete success!! I highly recommend this brand!!!! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9, 135 pounds.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  totally loveeeeee this lingerie set. just super sexy. i'm a camgirl model. so i wear a lot of stuff like this. and when i got this order in the mail i was super thrilled to try it on and it did not disappoint at all! i wish it would let me upload a video to show it off better. but the pics i posted are of the top part only. it fits any body type. i am def not super skinny. i'm 5'4 and 124 pounds. so i got some weight on me. but it fits so greatly with my shape. i look hottttt. and boyyy do the guys melt when they see me in this. i def want to get more in different colors 100%. totally recommend getting this set!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Mine and the hubby's favorite. I own a ton of lingerie and this by far is my favorite I did order a medium but wish I would of ordered a small but that is no one's fault but my own.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Small really fit like a small! Finally!! (I have major issues finding ‚Äúsmalls‚Äù in lingerie on Amazon that actually fits like a small).Top is cute, and is very flattering on petite breasts. It ties so it can be adjusted to fit.Amazingly, the bottoms fit great, and are sexy and cute.I‚Äôve ordered several items from this brand and their smalls are either huge or ill fitting. This piece was my winner! Sexy, flattering, fitted- and I would definitely order again.For reference, I ordered a small, 5‚Äô5‚Äù 120lbs,30b/32a, waist 27.5‚Äù, hip 37.5‚Äù. My rib cage measure 27.5‚Äù, and I carry my weight on hips/butt.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Ok.. IT‚ÄôS AMAZING. I was a little skeptical at first. Usually sets like this run way too small, are made much bigger for up top and smaller down below. To give it to you straight, I‚Äôm 50, had 4 kids, 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 140 lbs and ordered a L, to be on the safe side. While I‚Äôm fairly happy with my body, I‚Äôm a realist and know that most items like this are made for the firm, still-perky 20-somethings that have yet to fall victim to time and gravity... üòÇTHAT SAID... this has beyond exceeded my hopes in being flattering! I‚Äôm natural (36 C), so yes, my girls don‚Äôt look like round, perky melons like in it (see ad üòÇ), BUT.. the halter top tie-style combined with the stretch of the fabric/ties actually lifts and gives me cleavage, like a regular bra. I‚ÄôM FLOORED. üò±  The bottom is actually fairly comfortable (as much as can be) and the straps do a great job at disguising any little mama pooch I have left. The stretch is just the best part of the whole thing.. comfortable, FORGIVING, and this set actually feels well constructed! I‚Äôve got things cinched and tied fairly tight, and I have no worries whatsoever that a strap will suddenly pop or rip.. at all.You young little things want a cute set that‚Äôll look awesome and flatter your assets while you still got ‚Äòem? This is that set. You mamas that still got it in ya but just need a little help showing to its fullest potential? THIS IS THAT SET. I just tried this on for the first time and had to leave a review right away, I‚Äôm that impressed...I‚Äôm buying these in EVERY. COLOR. üñ§

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I don‚Äôt normally write reviews ! But I had to for this product!! I bought this very skeptical! I love it though !! I needed it for a boudoir shoot I have coming up! It‚Äôs very stretch Material and ties in the back and around the neck like a bathing suit top. The bottoms are strappy and sexy! Definitely will be buying more! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 145lbs athletic with a generous size booty and ordered a large and fit perfect !! Ladies buy these you will not regret it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great outfit. Fits perfect

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs very nice and it fits perfect!

  I weigh 193lbs and I‚Äôm a DD breast. I was a little concerned about how this may have looked because I have a large belly. To my surprise this teddy does a great job at minimizing my belly. It does not have that much breast support but my breast looked decent. I bought a size large and it fit perfectly. The material is soft with some stretch. I don‚Äôt know if it will still look good after I wash it. It really doesn‚Äôt matter because the price was great.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love love love it! I want to buy it in every color!!! I'm a little 38H in bra size/220-230lbs and this is soo flattering!!! This top does not support the big boobs like a bra so if you're self conscious about your natural chest you may or may not love it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Helpful info: I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7, 220 lbs and a 40 DDD. I wear a size 18-22 and got a 2x.Fair warning, there is no underwire, so if you‚Äôre like me and have large breasts, be aware. That said, it is so beautiful. The cups are not big enough to cover my chest and the middle of the bust where the straps meet does not sit flat against my chest, but if you have sewing skills and access to a JoAnne‚Äôs you can get some underwire to stitch on in there. There are no tears around the seams, slight puckering around the leg holes but when I put it on, it smooths right out. Very soft, the lace is perfect.I would not wear this out of the house as a top just because of the chest situation, but if I had a matching red bra or a jacket or something, it could be very cute. Overall, 9/10 great idea, good execution, wish it were larger in the bust.Edit: knocking it down to three stars because it has broken in several places. A small hole opened in the front lace panel and the right strap broke at the back.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered this last minute for a lingerie party & got so many compliments! I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect but the quality was great & even held up in the washing machine! The large fit nicely but when I order again I‚Äôm going to try a medium -I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 150lbs 38C

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I loved it !!! I thought it was going to fit right but it fit perfectly and I‚Äôm really impressed by the quality. I‚Äôm 155 and I‚Äôm a 36 D

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù about 150lb and got a large. It fits a little bit loosely but I‚Äôm happy I got it instead of a medium because it‚Äôs comfortable and flattering. Obviously this is for bedroom play or photo shoots, but it‚Äôs soft and comfortable enough that you could definitely sleep in it as well. The shape is very flattering especially on the bosom. One my favorite pieces of lingerie. Would certainly purchase again!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Nice fit, not 2 tight. Got tons of compliments! Beautiful sexy top! Great buy!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  loved it very sexy

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Ameee este body, estira mucho asi que tal vez una medida mas peque√±a hubiese funcionado mejor pero no me arrepiento de todas formas, queda hermosoooo

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  ABSOLUTE CRAP!The cups for a large are ment for someone with A cups.. the clips the hold it together on the coochie are plastic and as soon as ypu disconnect them they won't stay connected anymore when put on. That cups are also completely see through not as pictured at all. I am beyond disappointed.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Est√° bien en general pero no lo volver√≠a a comprar. Yo compr√© una talla m√°s por qu√© soy muy alta y no quer√≠a sentirme inc√≥moda del panty, el bra no da soporte (no tengo problema con esto) y el arn√©s ven√≠a mal hecho una tira muuuucho m√°s larga que otra lo tuve que arreglar.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Se ve bien, compr√© Xl por ser 36D pero me queda un poco grande d todo lo dem√°s, incluso del talle. Recomiendo lo compren chicas con menos boobs. A√∫n as√≠ lo usar√© üòâ porque se ve bien y es c√≥modo.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs pretty, but unfortunately the threading on the strap wasn‚Äôt secure and the strap completely broke the first time I wore it (only for photos, wasn‚Äôt being rough). I‚Äôm sad cause it was so cute and I really don‚Äôt want to go through the process of returning it.

  I usually wear size large in lingerie. I ordered XXL based on reviews, I probably could've worn an XL but didn't want to take chances. I am 5'4"" about 160lbs and am a 36DDD, tiny waist, thicker thighs and a big booty. The XXL fit fine. Snap crotch. It looked very sexy and hid my areas that I'm insecure about. Hubby loved it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My husband loved it. It fit perfectly. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 259 and 42 DD on bra size and, I got XXL

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I loved everything, wish it had a little more fabric covering the bottom of my stretched out tummy.  I like that part of my tummy supported because I have had 4 children, I am approaching 50 and the skin there is not all that it use to be.  Other than that, I loved the way I looked.  I am a 5'7,"" 36C, and a size 12.  I ordered a large in the nude color.  It definitely is more sheer on me than the model, I could see through the material and my belly button and areolas show, which I loved, but that is the only difference I could see from the photo.  The top could definitely fit a woman with larger breasts than me, and I appreciated that I could adjust the straps to lift mine.. The lace is soft and not itchy at all.  I felt sexy and beautiful.  I'd buy it again.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  For this piece to look like the photo I definitely need a bigger rack. I'm a B cup with my breasts sitting towards the front, not the center of my chest. Since the top doesn't have any wiring, or real structure, my breasts hung naturally so there was a large gap between the bra lace and the strings crossing the front. The piece overall was nice and soft, and decently stretchy. I loved the cut of the back as it made my legs look as though they went on for days. Unfortunately I don't think that I was necessarily the right body type overall as the mesh of the piece bunched in weird places which I personally wasn't into.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôve always wanted a piece with the strings at the chest, but have been nervous because I do have a larger chest.Lemme tell you: this piece was EXTREMELY flattering to my large chest. Definitely a piece I‚Äôd recommend!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It fits really nice and is very sexy.  I generally wear a medium but I got this in a small and it fits perfect.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  While this particular item fits as I was expecting, I did order 1 up from my normal size. I am 5'8"" 150 lbs, 34ddd. I usually wear a medium bottom with a med-large top (depending on cut and style). Since this was a 1 piece, I felt I would need the large for my top situation, and I did. However, the bottom is stretchy enough that it's not baggy on the bottom, and the straps are adjustable. There is no support, so this isn't something I could wear in public, but that wasn't my intention anyway. Husband felt it was quite flattering, so that's a win.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fit perfectly. Got rave reviews!

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 weighing 210 and I brought an xl but it‚Äôs stretchy so you can actually go down a size if you want It to fit a little tighter

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Yo for a 2xl it sure did fit like a medium. Idk what woman wants to see 2xl on the tag and it not fit when she usually wears a large regular. Made my wife feel bad. Not cool. Not true to size. Don't buy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I LIKE THE LOOK BUT THE QUALITY I AM BIT DISAPOINTED THOUGH THE PRICE IS WORTH. I ONLY WISH I'VE GOTTEN A SIZE SMALLER. I AM A FORMAL MODEL SO PLEASE DO NOT COMPARE MY IMAGE TO YOURSELF EVERY WOMAN IS DIFFERENT. WE ALL MUST LOVE OUR BODIES WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Omg I was so surprised when I received the light blue at how comfortable and how it actually fit in all the right places and the fabric is so silk like jot itchy nylony or Lacey - I ended up just ordering now the light pink- the price and the item is a great deal I def will be buying more colorsI ordered a size MEDIUM in the light blueI am 5‚Äù6 and roughly 179 pounds .. I have wide hips and due to my 2 kids I have a little pouch- the panties cover my pouch and my goodies perfectly and no extra flab sticks out or rolls over on the sides or top! Love love love !!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The bottom fit perfectly but the top is too small. I needed to size up but then the panties would've been too big on me. It needs to be away that the customer can put the size of each piece as a set

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bottoms are so strange unless you look like this model I guess. I felt like spongebob squarepants but I will say the top part is cute and I don‚Äôt have the perkiest girls either so I was pleased to have adjustable straps but definitely jor the neat for bigger chested ladies because there is no under wire/elastic or cinching that helps to hold them up. Not worth it honestly I would upgrade a little if you can.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The model is absolutely gorgeous. This was for my wife and she is a nice meaty figured woman however the outfit was smaller then advertised and she thought it was cheap quality. Buyer beware.  Unless you have implants like these, this outfit has no support and nothing as pictured. Also runs tight.

  I love this babydoll nighty so much! I am considering buying it in every color. When I go to bed I feel like a tv show divorc√©e. I have been looking for a lingerie night gown that isn‚Äôt tight around the tummy area for so long and finally found one. Lingerie fashion is in too! I would consider wearing this out with a fuzzy purse and fun earrings for a Y2k look. Get this. And get it in every color.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this nightgown!  I ordered a XXL which was perfect for my 5'2"" 200lb frame and I am planning to wear it under my robe while getting ready for my upcoming wedding. The fabric is very soft and comfortable and the lace portion is not irritating. The cut is also very flattering on my frame and skims over the stomach vs. highlighting it. The top is a good balance of adequate coverage and revealing, but certainly your bust is not going to look like the advertised photos... If you are bigger chested like me, you may have some slippage moderate happening. If your cup size is bigger than a C I'm not sure the top would fit comfortably, though the adjustable straps help to adjust the fit the way you want. Speaking of the advertised photos, the lace portion below the bust fits more straight across vs. on a V like in the photos. Overall, I adore this nightgown and would buy again in a heartbeat!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  For reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3, 160 lbs, 36c, size 8 pants medium shirt...I ordered a medium. It fits pretty well, the material is super soft and comfortable. It doesn‚Äôt cling which is nice. I wish there was a bit more (or ANY) support for the girls but overall I like how comfortable it is.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered a size down for my measurements (5'6"", 160lbs, 35"" underbust, 40"" bust --usually 36DD bra), cause I always regret getting clothes that fit my measurements, as they always end up a little big (goodness knows why). This fits perfectly, but is a tiny bit snug under my breasts, and because I'm super sensitive that may not be ideal for sleeping. But I swear to God I'm gonna wear this as a sexy dress! :) Ordering a bigger size to sleep in.I have a bit of a gut, and the soft fabric skims it in the most flattering way. It offers just a tiny bit of support, and feels s bit like a shelf came in terms of comfort. While looking absolutely stunning.I'm seriously impressed, and since I know a bit about fashion and bodies, I highly recommend this as it is pretty much guaranteed to be universally flattering (breasts over E cup may spill out, tho).

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So order your regular size on this... If you wear a US Medium in dresses that would be the right size here and let me tell you it's incredible for the price. Fabric is a little cheap, like trim your hang nails cause I felt mine snag but the bust fit is incredible, making this so flattering and actually comfortable. I'm currently considering implants after 3 kids and middle age hitting me hard, and this made my 40 yr old 34DDs look fabulous with no padding. This is definitely something you can comfortably pass out in after a sexy night.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love the design and color but feels more like a summer dress than a slip or nighty. I am 5 ft 2 in and 137 lbs got a size medium

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered a XL in size. It fits great and luxuriously  soft against the skin. I am 195 pds, 5'9 , and a 40 D . Its it very pretty and well made.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  i love this nightgown. it‚Äôs very comfortable and lightweight. The only downside is that there isn‚Äôt much support for my chest. Whenever I try to adjust the straps they don‚Äôt stay put, but other than that I love it 10/10.

  ¬†Great buy great fit  the material is amazing nice and strong so it won‚Äôt rip when putting it on the size is perfect I got a medium and it fit just right. Don‚Äôt think about it just get it you will feel so sexy great for lingerie partying boyfriend or girl friend adventures just get it üòçüòçüòç

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Size medium says for A, B and C cups but it is DEFINITELY NOT. The top is not flattering at all and there‚Äôs no way to adjust it to fit better. For reference, I‚Äôm between an A and B. Nothing about this top fits right. Maybe the smaller smaller sized top would have fit better but then the rest would have been way too small. Bottom line, if ur not at LEAST a full B or C cup, don‚Äôt bother. The top won‚Äôt be flattering at all.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  nothing lined up correctly and even the cups are attached differently. It‚Äôs super poorly made and if you don‚Äôt mind the fact it looks like a toddler glued it together, you‚Äôd like this.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I really love the style, color, even the material, but the garment was already torn before wearing. I think I may be able to stitch a fix for a one time use, but I am so disappointed in the quality. I got neon green 2XL and my bra size is a 38D. Fits great!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am in love! Fits great and comfy and makes the butt pop!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is not made for those of us with modestly-sized breasts. I did not look sexy. Had to return

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered a large and probably could‚Äôve gotten away with a medium. It‚Äôs very stretchy and more of a supportive style bra. It‚Äôs not as tiny as most of the sets bras but what it makes up for in coverage, it has in sexy. The straps are all very expensive looking and the thigh garters help connect the middle piece down. It‚Äôs a very supportive style and could fit a bigger bust easily. I‚Äôm 36D and it had a lot of room for another cup or two if needed

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is true to size. You get all 4 pieces.I have ‚Äú love handles ‚Äú so of course the thing does not look good in my body type , so I just used another place lace panties that I had.But product is great not issues with it.All traps on the garment and bra are adjustable

  It looks beautiful and very sexy. I love it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very sexy and but see through well made and pretty

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is SO comfortable. It's super light and I love how it's see through. It feels like you're wearing nothing at all. It fit PERFECT. I am definitely gonna buy this is multiple colors!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Color is nicer than pictured. The material is soft and fits very well. Size is very accurate. Outfit is a must to a collection. Another thumbs up for Avidlove and Amazon.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Cute, and fit as it should.  I was worried it would be one of those XL that's actually a size 2, but it was perfect.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Looks great and fits larger busted women....unlike some other lingerie that don't!  It is very sheer and lightweight.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  When I first tried buying lingerie for my wife I failed miserably.  To the point that I stopped even trying for about 5 years.  On a whim I decided to try again and found an Avidlove set that she loved and fit her perfectly so they are now my go to brand!  After digging through some old stuff I realized how much I like the mesh see through stuff already in her collection so I wanted to add to it.  I was quite happy with the results!  I cannot comment on the comfort or stretch, to be honest it didn‚Äôt stay on very long, but it seems like both should be 4-5 stars from what I could tell.

  Extremely sexy and very comfortable...!!

  I am 5'6"" and 125 lbs. I bought a Medium and it fit perfectly. It is a lovely color. My husband loved it even though I was not wearing it long.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super sexy, lightweight but not delicate or cheap material. Fit as expected. Very flattering. Will be one of my favorites now!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Men, spend the fifteen bucks and get one for your Lovergirl.  This one is not sheer, and leaves a little to the imagination.  The elastic that runs under her breasts might be a little tight, so men, be careful ""you"" don't stretch it.  Your gal will look great in it and feel sexy as well.I also bought the Avidlove Women's Babydoll Lingerie Sexy Bridal Nighty Mesh Chemise Dress Sheer Negligee, in red, for less than sixteen bucks.  This one is very sheer and leaves almost nothing to the imagination.  Be careful not to order the cross-strap, unless its preferred.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I wore this to a lingerie party, and all of the ladies loved it. They want one now. Lol! The material is flowy but still shows your cleavage so well. Absolutely my fave! The stockings not apart of the lingerie. Add on.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 200lbs and the XL fit perfect. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt know who they think the g string is going to fit, but there‚Äôs no way ITS fitting inside iykyk... I‚Äôll attach the photo of the g string  for reference. I‚Äôm very insecure about my tummy which is why I ordered this item and I have no insecurities wearing this! It‚Äôs very flattering and boost your confidence. My piece doesn‚Äôt separate in the center like some of the ad photos showed. For the price the quality is awesome!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This piece is beautiful and soooo comfortable. I like lingerie that hides my tummy and this did exactly that even though it‚Äôs completely see through.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This feels and fits great!!  The g-string for underneath is ok, but the actually babydoll lingerie is amazing.  For reference, I am 5'7, 130, 34B.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Omg adorable! I'm 5'7 210...fits like a glove. I have a belly and this is perfect...

  Edit, two years later!This lingerie is still fantastic! It's lasted well, without any of the lace falling apart or becoming scratchy. It's stood the test of several costumes, as well as getting rave reviews in my love life. I bought another color about a year ago (red), which was a great vibrant color, exactly as pictured, and felt and fit the same as the first one. I may just buy another color this year!2019 review:Oh my god. This is great. I'm 5'1"" and about 275lbs, which I carry around my lower belly, butt, and thighs. I purchased the 4X. This item is amazing. It fit perfectly. Some things to note in particular:- It's not scratchy. It's very comfortable. Sometimes lace and fishnet material gets scratchy, but this is not just comfortable but borders on soft.- The crotch snaps are barely noticeable. You know they're there, because you saw them or used them to put it on, but you can't feel them when the item is actually on.- The straps are adjustable. This really helped me because I was able to adjust the straps so the top of the teddy actually held my boobs in place (I wear a 42DD).I'm just honestly really overwhelmed. I ordered this item to use for Halloween, and I had my doubts. It didn't have very many reviews, but it was a low price, so I went for it. It came within two days (Prime), fit exactly like I wanted it to, and, the cherry on top, it was a low price. I highly recommend this. Plus size girls gotta stick together, so I made sure to write this review right after trying it on.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm very happily surprised at how nice this is for the price! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù currently 140 Lbs & 34D. I‚Äôve gained 10-15 lbs recently and carry that weight in my belly and chest so I wanted something to cover that.  I have a short torso and this fits great lengthwise so I‚Äôm not sure if it would be great for someone that‚Äôs taller, but there are adjustable straps to give a little extra room. There is no support in the bust, but with the way it‚Äôs low cut, it still looks great. Also, fits awesome on the butt. It cuts high up and doesn‚Äôt leave anything to the imagination in the back, but with the front covered, that‚Äôs a plus. I‚Äôm surprised at how soft it is too!Only con is that it smells like chemicals. I hand washed it in the sink and it bled badly. I‚Äôd suggest only handwashing for this reason.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 190lbs and I got this in a XL. I LOVEEE this! I felt very confident and sexy when I tried it on and my boyfriend liked it too!! I wanna wear this everyday

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'9 165lbs. 40,35,43 measurements. I ordered the Xl and the fit is amazing. The quality is suprising for the cost. The lace is soft and silky, not itchy like some other lace lingerie I have purchased. The button closures are quality. The color is exactly as advertised. Excellent quality and find for a cheap price!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Loved this body suit! It fit like a glove great quality!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I absolutely love this outfit. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 145 lbs with 36 DDDs at my age I‚Äôm super proud of them üòù. I got a large and it fit good. Little loose on the rear cause all my goods are up top (unfortunately). I paired this with a black mini shirt and strapped heels for a night out.  I threw over a white button up just in case people said anything.  I‚Äôve never felt sexier.  My husband was happy.  Win win

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'3 and 150lbs. Womens size 6/8. I am hippy. The medium is way too tight down below, but I bought this as lingerie so, it serves its purpose. I could never wear it out in day light with an outfit. The V comes way further down below than the photos portray. But I do realize that I may need a large. But again, its fine for me. I would say order a size up. The material and quality is as expected. Thank u!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Really happy with this item! I am 5'6"" and a 42D cup and a size 20 in pants, I wear a 1 or 2 in stores like Torrid for panties, I carry all my weight in my tummy due to diastasis recti. I wish this had just a liiiiiiittle more chest support, but the cleavage angle is flattering anyway. The lace is a nice thickness and I like the strategic panels that offer peekaboo but not totally sheer. I ordered a 4X and I don't think changing size would make a difference; it fit just right in terms of tightness, not uncomfortable but not too loose either. I may buy it in more colors! It came in a frosted plastic zip-top bag.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great quality and fast delivery ! Fits perfect to my size !!

  survived in the drier but should air dry, dress to success in the bedroom ;)

  Medium fit mostly except for breast area. My breast are 36 DD though some D and C fit so it's always difficult.  I honestly didn't relize it didn't have stocking just extra thongs. Originally this said 3 piece I assumed. I'm 170 and 5'7 if that I helpful.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very nice to wear for hubby.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Omg I did not think this would be such good quality and fit so great. I have a small belly and big boobs and the XL was so pretty and flattering on me. I can‚Äôt wait for my special weekend with my love, this makes me feel super sexy and beautiful. Buy it now!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am a triple DDD I fit The outfit part, but not the cup size my boobs fall out the top. I would see if you may be a C- D  it would fit. No bigger Unless you have a perky boob job

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Thread pulled and ripped through fabric. Also, I ordered a large and the cups barely fit a small. Incredibly disappointed in this product.  Don‚Äôt waste your money here.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The cups are NOT sized correctly. I fit in the small size by the guidelines, but ordered medium just in case (which I was still in the size measurements). The cups wouldn't even cover my nips in the medium. I am a 34 D. But the bottoms and waist were way too large. Would not recommend.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Cute but top piece doesn‚Äôt come as far down as it seems to on the model. Could just be my torso- but definitely covers less stomach than the image

  So cheaply made and not flattering.

  Super cute! Great buy, I will definitely be purchasing in other colors. I am 5'3 and 125 lbs, small bust and larger butt - Small fit perfectly.  Love the adjustable straps. I didn't use the included g string.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this nighty, but after one wearing of it, it was super loose.  So, if you want it to stay snug, you have to wash and dry it after each use.  My lover really liked it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  5ft 5 165lbs..i bought a Medium. Fit is perfect, stretchy material. Thong was way too big. I will be ordering different colors.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The material is very soft. Feels great on. The straps are adjustable too. I‚Äôm extremely happy with this purchase!

  We liked everything about this ...flattering..soft..arrived on time..price. My lady is so sexy in it!!

  Sexy but comfortable! good quality if you wanna be a lil hot but still comfortable this is it! the fabric is very soft. I ordered S and I am 5' and 130 lbs.  Red wine is the color.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits as listed for size. The G string runs runs big. I really bought the top for my wife. The G string went on my rear view mirror.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My wife looked so stunning in this, that I couldn't take my eyes off of her, and then I couldn't keep my hands off of her, and then....let's just say I couldn't wait for this to come off either.  It was some of the best I've ever had.  Even though it covers the midriff, I find myself insisting on her wearing this most times we ""get together.""Edited to add:  I bought the Medium (she's between a Small and a Medium) and it fit just a bit snug.  If you prefer a little more room, order one size up from what you usually wear.  If you have a large bust (she's a 34C, so we were ok with the M) order two sizes up.  It doesn't have a lot of room in the chest area.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is so soft and comfy. Panties are a tad weirdly made with the puckering at the front of the fabric, but I‚Äôm picky!Honestly in love with the nighty

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Si quieres que te quede a la misma altura de la foto, eacoge una o dos tallas m√°s.  Yo ped√Æ la chica y el color y la tela me encantaron, lo uso como blusa para dormir, pero literalmente me llega a penas y a la cadera.. como 10 cm menos de lo q esperaba.  Le doy 4 strellas x la talla!!!

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù & 170 lbs that wears a 38B and I felt like a goddess in this.  I bought a large & it was a bit snug at first but snug in the chest at first but stretched after a few minutes. The ability to adjust the halter was a nice touch. You can tighten it to where you want it and help give the ‚Äúsisters‚Äù a nice boost making them look nice and perky.  The thong is a string thong and not in the least bit comfortable to sleep in.  I didn‚Äôt use the garter belt stuff so not sure about those.  I‚Äôm considering buying a few more.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Of course my husband LOVES IT, which no lie i like it to just not the top. I ordered a bigger size just because of my boobs.  It doesn't cover enough, or give them support so I'm sexy with saggy boobs, that doesn't exactly make me feel all that sexy. After having 3 kids its hard to feel amazing about your body, but after losing over 50 lbs all but breast of course finally feeling confident to wear stuff like this for not just my husband but for myself.  It also has a VERY LONG ribbon that goes around your stomach and ties in the back which is so big it just comes undone. The boob area is like a bikini where it ties around your neck. So I thought that would be better but na it's still hard to get it to stay tied to keep saggy boobs up üôÑü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

  This item was okay! Not great by any means where i wasn't blown away but it's also not terrible either where I'm disappointed in the product. It's a nice cheaper option that gets the job done rather than paying a fortune for something of a similar style. It was a little bigger than expected and a bit confusing to figure out at first. I do wish it came with stockings rather than just the top and panties

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This was my first time buying lingerie online. I just had my second baby a few months ago and really low on self esteem, I figured something cute that covered my ""problem areas"" would help me- and it did. I'm 5'4"" and 195lbs with 38DDD boobs, I ordered an XL and was not disappointed.The lace is surprisingly stretchy, soft, and supportive (at least as supportive as a lace halter can be for nursing boobs!) And I like the silky-feeling ribbons. It made me feel cute and it was comfortable.I cannot give anything on the garter/thong included because my husband didn't let me get that far, if you catch my drift.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I have this in pink and in red. It looks so good on me. I got a medium and I'm 5'2, 145, 36D. 36 30 40 ish on measurements. I get a little insecure about my middle but this is really flattering and forgiving. I usually order large/xlarge but I did medium so I can give my breasts more support. It fits great. I'm going to eventually buy in more colors as well. My only complaint is that bow on the pink was a little wrinkled, but it's fixable and I look so good in it that my fiance would never notice that.

  This piece is beautiful! But it didn‚Äôt look great on me. The straps on the sides (that connect the front with the thing in the back) were placed in a bad spot, and gave me love handles. üò¨ I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 150 lbs. I got a medium. It did ride up some in the front, but I think it‚Äôs because of the way the thong is made. Regardless of the fact that this showed off all my worst assets, I felt pretty. The skirt is great, and detachable. My BF got to see a sneak peak, because he works out of state right now, and he said, ‚ÄúI love it. Can‚Äôt wait to take it off you!‚Äù So I think it did the trick! Haha I would not be afraid to order up a size.

                    The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†So I am 5‚Äô2 165lbs . I bought this in a medium. The Thong is not to tight & it is stretchy . It is Sexy & just right for my Lingerie Bash.

  I‚Äôm 95 pounds and 5 feet tall and this fit me perfectly. The quality feels nice and the sheer wrap is so pretty

  Love, love, LOVE. I am 5‚Äô8, 120 pounds and I ordered a small and it was perfect for my boudoir shoot. High quality low price point‚ô•Ô∏èüíã

  I am 5‚Äô6 and 128lbs. I got a small. I love how it fits. I did have to loosen the straps all the way but I feel as though medium would have been to big. I LOVE IT. Yes the top is see through. Probably my favorite lingerie purchase off of Amazon. I am definitely going to get the red one next.  The quality is great for the price. And I‚Äôll be using the bottoms as a beach cover it‚Äôs the perfect length.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is beautiful,  I love it. I ordered a Large. Measurements are 33"" waist, 34"" bust, & I am 5'5"".  It is very flattering & I highly recommend. Don't sleep on it ladies.

  Bought this for a valentines day photo shoot its very comfortable, sizes are correct fit great and has a stretch

  Very beautiful set! I love how it comes with a sheer long tie up skirt! It totally completes the look and adds definite sex appeal! You can totally pair the sheer skirt with other outfits too (which i definitely plan on doing)!I was worried the teddy would be to short and be uncomfortable,due to my long torso! But it wasn‚Äôt it fit perfectly!I ordered a small Im 5,5 135 pounds 34 c i wear a size 4-6 in bottoms and a size small in tops!I hope this helps!!

  This gave me a confidence I did not know I had!! It looks so good on! It‚Äôs not really a revealing babydoll in comparison to others, but I does have a sexy high slit. Definitely felt very sexy in this. I already recommended it to friends, definitely a must buy!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great quality! Super soft and very comfortable and sexy omg. I was nervous because I‚Äôm more curvy and I wear a size H bra!!! Yeah, typically I am a large in most things I wear but a XL up top and M-L at the bottom so I bought the XL and it‚Äôs fits wonderfully and has a lot of stretch and flows great! I could‚Äôve probably even went a size down. I‚Äôm shocked and sooo satisfied. I will def be buying the other styles.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love it

  Bought this attire for my wife to wear in the boom boom room! Let me first say how amazing my beautiful wife looks in anything but I decided on this one because she is definitely that ‚Äúcat lady‚Äù and the leopard print seemed to be right up her alley! As soon as my eyes saw her I was like an old Tom cat roaming the neighborhood for some action and I had found my prize! Animal instinct took over and the mating ritual began! It was hot and heavy and there was definitely purrs to be heard! Suddenly I heard her gasp and then yell in a way that I haven‚Äôt heard in action before. Suddenly I realized she was under attack‚Ä¶.. Keep in mind I told you earlier that she is indeed a ‚Äúcat lady‚Äù‚Ä¶ well obviously in the heat of the moment we didn‚Äôt secure the door to the boom boom room and her flock of felines had gathered around to see what all the commotion was about. Then it hit me‚Ä¶. She is being attacked by her own cats because this attire had fooled them all together! In their eyes she wasn‚Äôt their human at this point, she was a unknown feline and they were there to attack! They slashed, bit, and gouged at her in attempt to destroy the intruder of their home! Suddenly the shock wore off and I sprung into action! The first casualty was her youngest Siamese because he seemed to be doing the most damage. One swift swipe to the throat with the Samurai sword I swindled from the renaissance fair left young jo-jo limp on a blood soaked duvet as his head was no longer a part of him! Then half of the gang turned their attention to me because they knew that this had become war! I took a row of scratches from patches right below my left eye before I was able to subdue him with the rear naked choke. My wife was torn between her love for her cats and her own survival at this point. The proverbial ‚Äúrock and a hard place‚Äù but she knew she must fight to survive! She kicked Pee-wee with so much might his departure from the battle was probably quick and painless (or that‚Äôs what I tell my wife to ease her guilt) and then it was down to us against the childrens cat‚Ä¶. Spongefield (named as a settlement between the two names that were finalists to keep peace) old Spongey had seen the demise of his whole brigade but he fought till the end like a valiant soldier. Several blows with a Doc Martin finally eased his mind and the battle was over. My wife and I were treated for several lacerations and have the scars to prove it. It was a learning experience for sure and although we steer clear of the predator prints now, 5 stars was warranted for its realistic appearance.,, and man did my wife look amazing with her beautiful bruised and bleeding body in her shredded lingerie in the emergency room!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm seven months pregnant but ordered down a size for the BOOM factor. This little negligee did not disappoint. The tightness provides excellent breast support for these swollen knockers, and the sleek, stretchy fabric hugs my bonus curves seductively. The side slits and leopard print make it extra racy. Plus it‚Äôll look even sexier once I lose the baby weight. A+ from my husband as well ;-)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Would highly recommend, great product, great fit, true to size!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered this for a boudoir photoshoot and it‚Äôs so cute and soft. The only thing is that the slip on the sides is higher up than it appears in the photos. It‚Äôs also a bit tighter than expected but in all its decent to use for a photoshoot.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Definitely size up, it does not fit what it says.

  No, you don't get to see a picture of my wife wearing this lingerie, but take my word for it, this is well worth the money. It's sexy without being slutty (well, maybe a little slutty), it looks great, feels great, and is easily removed either slowly or in somewhat of a rush. Do yourself (or your husband) a favor and pick one up today. Actually, for the price, get 2, you can never go wrong with more. :-)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The material is very soft and comfy and both pieces are very cute. It's ties in the front between the breasts, which I didn't notice before ordering but it's fine. My only complaint is that it leaves a large empty gap between my breasts that makes my chest look flatter. I'm going to do some sewing to adjust, since I can't simply grow larger breasts to fill in the cups and pull it closer lol. Overall though, very nice

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not the most flattering when you have somewhat of a pooch belly. I purchased this thinking it was kind of a peekaboo belly and instead my whole stomach was exposed. Great material though beautiful color. I ended up gifting it to my sister she loves it it fits her perfectly.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My husband loved this on me, there wasn't a ton of support for your chest but its not like it was on very long. Super cute.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bought of a girlfriend. But didn't have a chance to give it to her. So not sure how they fit. Are look on her. But the price is ok. Maybe I will find a girlfriend to give it to some day.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I purchased a XXL. The color is very nice and vibrant but it‚Äôs definitely not like advertised. When tied shut it still shows my stomach and doesn‚Äôt really hug the girls like advertised. While I can make this piece work for me, I feel like this piece is more for women with perky breast.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This item has lots of pretty colors to choose from.  I have a couple of them.  This item fits well and is very sexy.  Not only is it hot!, it is very comfortable to wear.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Comfortable.  Actually very pretty

  The robe is at least 7 inches too short.  Came to my upper thigh, definitely not long. I ordered a medium, my typical size, but should have ordered an XL because I wanted it to be loose like the photo.

  It‚Äôs a tad big in some areas but I‚Äôm happy with it overall

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fit as expected for SHEIN sizing. The Large is probably most suitable for a 10 or 12- I'm a true 14 and it's a bit small.I'm a 36G and the cups were obviously far too small, but the band has plenty of stretch.STRONGLY recommend (if you have the capability to do so) to sew down the lace onto the elastic garter bands. The lace wants to roll up and that's not a good look on anyone... I used a honeycomb stitch to preserve the stretchiness and so far it's worked well.Not much to say about the panties, they're cute and not wedgie-prone.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this set. Adjustable and fits nicely on everyone! Wore a few times and still in decent shape. Lace is soft and nice design and cut. I love how it fits. I'm busty and this fits great. I got a small in the burgundy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The bra piece was a little small but my boobs are used to that. Fits as expected. Loved the product.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The color is beautiful! (Yellow) I loved how vibrant it looks. 34DDD is my bra size at Victoria Secret, so I got a large. My br East didn‚Äôt really fit or look right in the large but I‚Äôm 100% sure if you don‚Äôt have bigger br East this set will be perfect. Even better since it‚Äôs cheap too.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The lace is soft and its a perfect fit. I ordered the small. I'm a 34C and a 25 waist..5'6 130lbs.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I needed yellow swim suit or lingerie for a photoshoot and this was the only thing close to yellow that seemed flattering that I could find. Fit nice enough for what I needed it to do. I wouldn‚Äôt wear this bra under a shirt so I probably wouldn‚Äôt wear it unless showing off for a significant other.I am 5‚Äô6 about 140 lbs athletic built with 34C cup. Fit okay but if your a lot smaller it be too big. I had it on the tightest fitting around the body and it could have been much tighter. The harder belt is too loose to actually use with sock/stockings so it be more for just the look. But was worth what I paid for what I needed it for

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very dissatisfied, as soon as I  tried to put my leg through the panties the panties broke. I didn't even stretch them that much. Very bad quality sewing. The other side was hanging by a thread as well.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This product fits a little wonky. Half is too big, the other half is too small. The lace is nice though

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered a medium (normally a s/m at la senza in lingerie) and the bra band, and the garter are quite loose. I am normally a 34b. Little disappointed but still wearable.

  Honestly, it's a solid buy. It fit exactly as I expected. I'm 20, 5'4 and 230 lbs. I don't have a tummy but as a pear shape, I have a bootyyy and thighs and large C cups and I bought the XL (which is my usual size). I LOVE that everything is pretty much adjustable so buy your size, you can always make it bigger or smaller. I bought an XL specially to make sure the top would fit me and not be too tight when I clasped it. I knew it was adjustable so I knew an XL bottom would be perfecty fine. It's not made of silk lol but as someone who has super sensitive skin and hates irritating fabric, this was more than manageable. It was all-in-all a solid buy :).

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I absolutely loved this! So did my husband. I ordered a small ONLY because there were no mediums available in white at the time. I intended to order a medium due to a review from another customer. They noted similar hip n bust size, n suggested buying a medium. But im so glad I ordered a small instead, because it fits so perfectly. The adjustable straps are there too. But I didn't have to use them on the bottoms. I used them a bit for the top to make my boobs look more lifted..the underwire helped with that as well. However, I bleve I ordered a black one in medium. Hopefully it's not oo much of a difference ü§´ overall, it's comfortable, hubby said it was the thing I've ordered. Having the crotchless n no ride-up thong was a plus for him. üòäwill certainly order this in another color. It's truly beautiful n better than anything I've seen or worn from Adam &Eve

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love that this product adds a little spice definitely something my husband was not expecting. However the top is slightly small as it does not have elastic in the band that goes around my body. I am a mother who nursed so I have a larger bust area so in looking for the support for smaller busts this would be perfect but to paint a mental image. Think of the squishy ball that‚Äôs wrapped in the black string with holes so when you squeeze it the ball try‚Äôs to pop out of the holes. Or even the little animals that when you squeezed there stomach the eyes popped out. <‚Äî-that‚Äôs what my bust reminded me of. Not flattering in the slightest. Definitely for the smaller busts.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  As a fat girl, I was nervous about whether this would fit. In my experience, whenever I come across lingerie that is cheap and cute it always runs a hundred sizes too small, but this set was adjustable and actually included fit info in the description so I used that to choose my size, read all the reviews and crossed my fingers. To my surprise, I feel very sexy in this set! The lace detailing is as beautiful as the pictures and not itchy. The bottoms are a different cut than I'm used to so they felt weird at first, but once I got the straps adjusted to where I like them and got used to the fit, they are actually fairly comfortable as far as lingerie goes (albeit still a bit tighter than I would prefer). If I were able to tailor the set for my body, I would prefer a higher waist on the bottoms and a partial cup on the top (to lift the girls), but with the quality of the lace and being able to find a sexy and unique set that actually fits plus size for such a low price, I really can't complain. I just layer the set with other lingerie/lounge wear and I love it! (So does my spouse.)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Took away one star because it smells like deodorant. Like someone tried it on, and returned it! ü§ÆHowever, after washing it, the fit is great and it is really sexy! It's nice to have a little cover. I ordered the XL since I have a broader top and smaller hips. I'm a 36c and the xl top fit perfectly (phew!). My hips are 38"", usually a Medium in leggings and the bottom felt big. But it still works!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm a size 8-10 in jeans (US sizing) and a 36 B in bras.I got this set in a Large based on reviews.The top was too large and couldn't be adjusted any smaller. Also, the stitching was crooked, but I think I noticed it more because I sew. So anyway, for a 36 B, a Medium top would have fit best. The large was a little loose and looks kindof silly.However, the bottom being a Large fit me perfectly and was adjusted as big as it could go. So I think a Medium bottom would have been too tight, unfortunately.Also, the ""crotchless"" part didn't seem to function for me personally, because the fabric came down too low....... and covered the portion of what is supposed to be accessible. Maybe that's just my anatomy, everybody has a different body, but I would have had to rip the lace to have the area open that I wanted open.In summary, it's pretty and it fits okay, and I think especially that it's a good value for how affordable it was. But it would maybe fit better for someone with different proportions than me (smaller hips).I'm definitely still keeping it because I like the color, but it's not my favorite piece.I hope that helps you!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Hubby‚Äôs favorite out of a batch of on line impulse buys during pandemic induced cabin fever. Fits well, more comfortable than I expected.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Was looking for something spicy for the bedroom and was excited for this outfit but ended up hating it. Feels very awkward, the butt area looks super plain, the top breast area fits awkwardly and quality feels really cheap. I didn't expect top of the line obviously for the price, but just wasn't well made and material is uncomfortable especially on the bottoms. I think this also will only be flattering on very curvy girls, but still probably not comfortable.

  I loved this... was exactly as described... I am sz 14, 210lbs and on the package it says 150-200 lbs...and it fit me... very flattering...  i did like how it hid my mommy tummy... I highly recommend this to every woman of every shape and size...Going to wear is this weekend for my husband...

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I tend to be more demure, and enjoy lacy, pretty little diaphanous negligees and the like, but saw this and decided to take a chance, even as risque' as it looks.My guy is on his way off for military training for about a month or two, and I wanted to give him something to think about while he's away.I decided to move the black breast bands a bit...lower... for a fully enticing effect, and from the moment he saw me in it, he couldn't keep his hands off me. He's normally a bit more restrained and patient, but not this time around! Instant amorous attention!Like many other women, I'm not so confident about wearing revealing garments, and this is easily the most risque' garment I own (even including my collection of underbust corsets - Timeless Trends is the way to go if you're interested. Worth EVERY penny, and the steel boning makes ALL the difference! Don't skimp there - you WILL regret it). I kinda had to psych myself up over a few days to wearing this for someone else to see me in, but when he DID see me in it, he could barely get me to the bedroom fast enough! ;-DIf you're looking for something to spice up your romantic escapades, this is it. At 5'6"" and 220 lbs, this still made me look sexy AF to him, so it's worth giving a go!Have fun! ;-)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great piece..im a size 18(5'6""/240lbs) and am bigger up top, with larger arms.. minus the boobs. Cleverly disguised my problem areas(see pic). Seems like it would work for anyone up to 24W.  This fit GREAT n was nice strong fishnet, kinda holds everything up and in. Stays in place, too... (neckline/hem) No dreaded rolling up or constant adjusting. Nice option when u like to feel covered up without being covered up. Excellent fit and quality. Dont think twice, worth every penny n unlike most, itll stand up to many wears. (Seen for $45 at adult store.)Thanks!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This outfit is perfect. I also was worried that it wouldn't fit. I'm 5'2 and 312lbs. It fits perfect and looks darn good! If you are on the fence...get it! I wear a size 26/28 and i believe it would fit bigger than me too...both width and length. Super stretchy!! Very durable.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The dress looks like it is for a toddler when it comes out of the box. However it is super stretchy and looks fabulous. I ordered This for a lingerie party. It looked and felt great so comfortable. I am plus size and short all of the blacked out parts were right where they needed to be love love love would order again

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It's a winner! This is one of those staple lingerie pieces, that will build your confidence and be the building block to wearing more lingerie in the future. The cut and design both forgives and flatters. This dress can stand alone as a single piece to wear, as the block cut outs provide coverage to all the key areas (on most frames and body types. A heavier,  larger breast will be trickier...but doesnt look horrible if you dont quite match up with the design.)

  I love this dress! I'm 5'1 about 200lbs with medium-large breasts (36C). It fits PERFECTLY. It arrives looking like it's doll sized or something but take a few minutes to put it on, stretch it out carefully and slowly so you don't accidentally rip the netting and you should be very happy!  All the solid black parts sat where they should and it's very comfortable, tight but not restrictive. As long as you aren't pulling it in weird ways the fabric seems pretty durable. I did get a run in it in the middle solid black piece but I think that was my own fault for pulling on it when I was laying down trying to position it. Not a big deal though it's not very noticeable and whoever you're wearing this for will not give a damn (unless you're wearing it for yourself and you're super picky about these things). Anyway, it's SUPER sexy and I felt great in it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was hesitant about this simply because it's one of the more expensive body stocking style dresses I've seen on Amazon but once I got it, I totally understood why the reviews were so positive. This is an absolute winner for all sizes, big and small. The blackout parts cover exactly where I need them to and I feel my confidence explode and come to the surface in this dress. Can't wait to where it to a fetish party.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Ripped the first time I wore it (and I was careful!). Would buy for $10-15 cause it did look hot. Not worth the price for a single wear.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fit great !!!!

  Questo articolo e bellissimo. Io lo uso come maglia a rete su una canotta e l' effetto e' davvero bello.Arrivato nella data prevista,bene confezionato,nessun cattivo odore,io sono una 56 e la taglia era perfetta. Ottimo rapporto qualita'/prezzo

  ¬†Great buy great fit  the material is amazing nice and strong so it won‚Äôt rip when putting it on the size is perfect I got a medium and it fit just right. Don‚Äôt think about it just get it you will feel so sexy great for lingerie partying boyfriend or girl friend adventures just get it üòçüòçüòç

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Size medium says for A, B and C cups but it is DEFINITELY NOT. The top is not flattering at all and there‚Äôs no way to adjust it to fit better. For reference, I‚Äôm between an A and B. Nothing about this top fits right. Maybe the smaller smaller sized top would have fit better but then the rest would have been way too small. Bottom line, if ur not at LEAST a full B or C cup, don‚Äôt bother. The top won‚Äôt be flattering at all.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  nothing lined up correctly and even the cups are attached differently. It‚Äôs super poorly made and if you don‚Äôt mind the fact it looks like a toddler glued it together, you‚Äôd like this.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I really love the style, color, even the material, but the garment was already torn before wearing. I think I may be able to stitch a fix for a one time use, but I am so disappointed in the quality. I got neon green 2XL and my bra size is a 38D. Fits great!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am in love! Fits great and comfy and makes the butt pop!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is not made for those of us with modestly-sized breasts. I did not look sexy. Had to return

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered a large and probably could‚Äôve gotten away with a medium. It‚Äôs very stretchy and more of a supportive style bra. It‚Äôs not as tiny as most of the sets bras but what it makes up for in coverage, it has in sexy. The straps are all very expensive looking and the thigh garters help connect the middle piece down. It‚Äôs a very supportive style and could fit a bigger bust easily. I‚Äôm 36D and it had a lot of room for another cup or two if needed

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is true to size. You get all 4 pieces.I have ‚Äú love handles ‚Äú so of course the thing does not look good in my body type , so I just used another place lace panties that I had.But product is great not issues with it.All traps on the garment and bra are adjustable

  Color: BlackPurchased Size: SmallI am 5'5"", 135 lbs, and a 34D. I typically wear a standard, US women's size 4.I purchased this for a Britney Spears costume. It was actually very comfortable to wear. Overall, the fit was true to size for me.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  A very cute and sexy skirt with a ton of potential, but it wouldn't even cover 1/2 of my wife's bottom even when she was standing straight.  She wanted super short, and is not shy, but there is just no way anyone could ever wear this except maybe over a bikini, which defeats the ""flirt"" purpose.  5'2""  with full hips, so got a size Large: Front length hits 1.5"" below crotch (okay), but the back would need another 4 inches just to reach down to a point that a full 1.5"" of cheek would show.  Unfortunately, we had to return it.

  my sister should not be allowed to wear this

  Actually an impressive skirt, nice material. Other than a comment saying 'skirt fits as regular size' I didn't see a size chart per se, but i used my/the standard (US) size(s)... & its two thumbs up Perfect!! I like the mini skirt style, material, fit.. Very pleased üåπ Well made/stitches, nice pleaded skirt. üëç

  I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 125lbs. I have a shorter torso and it fits me pretty nicely. Could be a little snugger, but it‚Äôs my body type so I won‚Äôt blame the clothing!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Too small. I‚Äôm a 36DD and the top covered nothing. I also have a short torso and the crotch was super stretched and was not flattering at all. I got a size XL

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Purchased this for an upcoming anniversary, and was disappointed when a side bust strap broke seconds after putting the piece on. It isn't too tight on my body, just shoddy sewing. It looks excellent on me, but I wouldn't purchase again based off of the quality of the sewing.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Beautiful. Sexy. Makes me feel beautiful. Shows off the curves perfectly.

  Bought this item for a photo shoot. I worked really well, fit perfectly and the color looked very nice on my skin. The fabric is soft and durable.

  Love love love it absolutely adorable just order one size up especially if your busty I'm 5-8 180 lb and loved it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Hubby loved it.  If you have a large chest,  that's your only concern.  I have a little bit of a belly (size 14-18 depending on fit and store) and this was perfect.  It even felt flattering.  For once,  something actually looks nice on an average person and not just a model.  If you're looking for a sexy piece of lingerie for less,  this is it:)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  LOVED this. I bought about 2 other sets off of amazon and this happened to be the only one that fit me right. Looked kind of small at first and it's a little tight to get past my chest area but its nothing unbarable. Infact i like it even better because my chest size is a 36C- 38C and it kinda held everything up. I'm 5'2 165-170 pounds and I ordered a medium. My body size isnt very big I wouldnt call myself fat because my weight is distributed evenly. But chubby with hips. I love how the dress piece covers up your stomach area for myself and my ladies with a little tummy on them. It's super sexy only exposes the sides of your hips. Only reason I sized at a medium was from looking at the pictures in the reviews. Saw a girl around my size or even bigger said she ordered a S and just to be safe I ordered a medium. Smaller girls dont be intimidated to buy this because it does fit us bigger girls too. A small and medium would fit perfectly on a smaller person. Feel like its almost a one size fits all.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My gf is a plus size female. Curzy in all the eight parts, big boobs, fits her perfectly. Would purchase again. If this is your first time buying these types of items it's not what it looks like in the image, quality looks better in the picture, but it's a deal for the money you pay. If you plan on using it everyday or for her to sleep in I would pay the extra money and get a victoria secret version. If it's something you want to experiment with and just build a collection and are on  a budget this is fhe product for you.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very comfortable except that it squished the girls down. The top doesnt have room nor stretch for large breasts. The underwear was twisted in an AWFUL mess. Returning..

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love it! I'm 5'4"" 145lbs 36c. Got medium and it fits just right. Fits a little tighter around the chest and the rest flows nicely. It's comfortable and looks just like the picture. I've ordered 3 different styles of avidlove nightgowns and am in love with them all. Highly recommended and will buy more.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very cute very soft. Nice material . My only issue is the size. It is very long as expected from a 2x however the upper part is very small. They didn‚Äôt take into consideration that big girls don‚Äôt just need more length, then need boob space . It flattens them out in an unappealing way because the cut isn‚Äôt correct to size.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So this gets five stars because it feels nice and the pictures looked nice. I haven‚Äôt seen it on my wife... guess I missed some implied/ unspoken communication on this one...

  If you are anything over a 38"" but a B cup you will find it IMPOSSIBLE to buy a bra.  This bra's B cup for 42 inch literally figs over an entire 38B bra. The cup is huge and clearly not a B at all. Apparently if you are larger than 38 inches ALL manufacturers especially Maidenform ASSUME that your bosom is larger too.  I have tried this bra in both 40"" and 42"" for a B cup and it's just wrong - the cup over a 38"" size is not a B at all.  The 40"" at least has just two claps. The 42"" has three clasps and not only toes my 38B Maidenform fit completely inside the 42B Maidenform but the distance in the front between the cups is almost the same and the length at the back of the bra is only 1"" different between the two. Why they think the inches around your body should be added to the base of the cup I don't know, and why the cup itself is so huge I don't know.  So yeah, if you are a B cup you better stay at 38"" or smaller or you will never find a bra (sport bra standard or otherwise) that fits without an increase in height and depth at the front.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I finally found a bra that fits my needs well. I am a mom of 5 so my breast arent full and perky by far. I have more skin than volume and one boob is about 1/2 size bigger than the other. I originally bought the Maidenform Comfort Devotion Demi T-shirt Bra style #09402 in store at Kohls but my boobs slightly popped out of the top. But I loved the fit of this bra so I looked for a full coverage in the same type of bra and I found this Maidenform Comfort Devotion-Extra Coverage bra #09436 on Amazon. I ordered 2 in my best size, 34C in the black and another in white. They both fit good. Comfortable and my girls are peaking out. Now I don't feel insecure wearing tight fited shirts.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This USED to be my favorite bra! I have purchased many of these bras over the past decade, but will sadly have to look for another style/brand now. The last dozen or so that I've purchased have all had the exact same defect - the wires quickly work themselves out after only a few wearings. I started sewing little seams along the sides to prevent the wires from doing this, but they still eventually find their way out! These Comfort Devotion bras used to be made so much better, and I could keep a bra for several years and never have a wire come out. I'm old, I've not changed my laundry patterns or anything else... it's the QUALITY of the bra, which is not nearly as good as it used to be. Unless you want a disposable-apparel item, this bra will not work. And, be prepared for the wires to poke their way out at the most awkward times, from the inside middles and the outside underarms of the bras... while you're presenting in a meeting, driving on a long trip, carrying something heavy... oh, goodness, you name it, these sharp wires will find you! MAIDENFORM, IF YOU'RE LISTENING, PLEASE PLLLLLLEASE FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET YOUR QUALITY BACK - I'm really going to miss this bra, but after trying it numerous times over the past two years and having this exact same issue, I'm going to stop buying it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I used to love these bras and have purchased these for years, but recently the quality has just gone down. Two of the last three bras I purchased have already broken. I had ordered one, figured it was a fluke when the wire busted through only a week later so I order two more since I've never had issues before. Unfortunately after only having these for 2 weeks another has already messed up. It is super irritating because these have always been my favorite because they fit well and are comfortable (up until now with poking wires). I'm not totally sure why the quality has gone down but it looks like I may have to look elsewhere. I should not be only getting a couple uses out of these before they break.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am about to order my 4th of these bras. I recently purchased a similar bra in a store and as soon as I put it on, I can‚Äôt wait to take it off. But THIS bra is totally different. I only take it off because I have to! It has got great support and is very comfortable. I never feel it digging in or ever have to adjust. I suppose it fits exactly how a good bra should.Edit: Still love them but one of the 4 I own has started to come apart. I hope it‚Äôs a fluke and I love them so much that I am probably going to buy a replacement.But buyer beware they are glued together.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I gave this bra two stars for its comfort and soft materials, but ultimately, I just don't wear it. The cups are too pointy and wide set for me. I feel like centers of the cups are significantly offset where...my centers are.  This is particularly noticeable to me because the cups are a bit more pointy than round. They may provide a nice ""natural"" shape on some but every time I put it on I feel like I'm channeling Madonna, and not in a good way.  Admittedly, I do prefer my bands looser and may have been better off going with a 36DD instead of a 38D in this bra, but that still wouldn't have changed the cup shape. Overall, it's a no for me. I tried it for a few wears hoping I'd change my mind...because it is comfortable, but nope, still a no.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Written by my wife: These are the BEST bras! I bought a couple of these bras a few years ago at a department store and loved them. I am thrilled that I found the exact same bra on Amazon for less than half the price I originally paid! They are so comfortable, give great support, give the slightest amount of push-up and fit perfectly. Having nursed three children, I have to have underwire and a little lift and this bra is perfect. The underwire is comfy, the cups are padded just enough for no-show and the adjustable straps are wonderful since I‚Äôm petite at 5 ft tall. I‚Äôm 116 lbs and wear a 34C, and the 34C fits me perfectly. I highly recommend this bra!!!

  Gorgeous. I didn't know there is also that lacing on the back, it was an extra bonus. However, I wish the very tops were wider in every way. Not much of a problem, but even though it's ""one size fits most"", please note ""most"" means girls on the slimmer side. I give these stockings 5 stars anyways, they are the cat's meow! Just watch your calories, lol.P.S: For some reason Amazon makes headings of some random pieces of my reviews, without me knowing it. For example, the heading for this one was: ""just watch your calories"". I don't think it was the main point! So embarrassing, I'm glad I checked it... similar story with my review of a different product. Ugh, I don't have time for that.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These fit as expected.  They really were absolutely beautiful on but arrived with a rip in them! I bought them to make me confident in an occasion I really needed it.  These just made me feel like a mess with the rip. If they arrive in good condition, they truly look great.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These are nicely made but not for bigger thighs unfortunately! :( They roll down way too easy!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These are hella cute and sexy- they look great on and would go with a cute short dress or not- lol super happy with my purchase

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Sexy, but they don't stay up. Have to use a garter belt.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very very cute!!!! Seems durable, but unless you have a garter belt, it won't stay up by itself, will constantly roll down

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I really liked the way they looked before I even put  them on. As I'm trying then on, I put a run in it with my thumb nail. So be careful as you're putting them on. They're really cute. Love the design on the back of the legs. Just wish they would have the silicone strips in them to keep in place without the garter belt. They roll down a bit on me.

  This bodysuit was as expected and so cute for a rave. I am 5‚Äô3 and 160 usually wear a size L and this fit me, just had to keep shimmy-ing it up my body and arms like you would a pair of fishnets. It stretches. Although the sleeves ended up being about 3/4 length. I was worried the rhinestones would be falling off everywhere but for the most part my bodysuit came out in tact after a night of dancing. The material was pretty durable. I was very careful with it but was tugging it up all night long and no rips! Downside is that it doesn‚Äôt stay on your shoulders very well so it will slide down a ton. I recommend this for raves, concerts, special event, etc!! I will get use out of it again since it held up so well. Just be gentle with it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I opened this and was terrified. It could fit a hamster. However, it stretches and doesn‚Äôt lose its shape or beauty. This is a beautiful piece of lingerie. I was seriously surprised. I ordered it and used it for a boudoir shoot after a friend showed me a pic of her wearing this as well! It looked great so I ordered it for myself. Sexy and comfortable and doesn‚Äôt dig in at all!!! Impressed and surprised.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am about 5‚Äô5 and 140lbs and this is GORGEOUS! It fits so so well! It‚Äôs so flattering too.. I have a fupa and you can‚Äôt even tell! I feel so so sexy in this!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I used this for a photoshoot and no way is this one size fits. My model is tiny and she could barely get it on her arms. What a waste!!!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Appears small out of the package, but stretches nicely. Fits as expected, comfortable, looked good on, & worth the money. Make sure to stretch it enough or it will keep falling off the shoulders. Also, it has a strange smell. I hand washed it then hung it up to dry prior to using. The rhinestones stayed on.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It fit perfectly and I‚Äôm a x large weights is 191 height 5,6

  I bought this for a boudoir photo shoot and needed something cute and didnt really care too much about quality. This was surprisingly really soft and flattering! I'm a size 6 on top and a size 8/10 hip and both pieces had enough stretch to fit me without cutting in or looking loose. It definitely fits a range of body types.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My gf absolutely loved this set (as did I!)! I ordered her a small, she is 5‚Äô3 and about 110# and it couldn‚Äôt have fit her better. Stockings are not included so make sure to order separately. She did say the connectors for the stocking felt a bit cheap but she had the set on for a few hours of playtime and they didn‚Äôt pop off at all. Also, loved that she was able to wear this without panties which is great because the outfit stays on opposed to others that are one piece and only end up staying in for a few mins. Also, the fabric is quite soft!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  5‚Äô5, 150lbs, small. The fit was fine but the overall quality had flaws. The bra cups were very over sized and different sizes. I find it unwearable due to the sizing but I also have a pretty small chest. The bra straps adjust but the back fastener is a one size and does not adjust.The skirt was nice but the back split was not the same length on both sides so the ribbon lacing was off. I like the picture shows, lace from the bottom. Also the garter straps do not adjust.Cute overall but I basically bought it for the little skirt garter which I will be able to use just fine.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super sexy - hubby loved it as much as I did.  The bra is just lace, but looked nice with the skirt/garter.  Unfortunately, I didnt realize stockings didnt come with but had black glitter thigh highs that worked fine!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The top is strange. It fits weird. It‚Äôs not flattering at all. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù 115 lbs and I ordered a small. I ended up wearing my own top I already owned but the bottom of this outfit is sexy and fit great. Had to lace it myself. It did not come laced so that took some unexpected time but my boyfriend loved it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Ive received some surprisingly incredible lingerie from Amazon (other brands). This piece looked good in pics but arrived very wrinkly and cheap looking. I‚Äôll keep & wear but the material feels/looks cheap so imo this isn‚Äôt worth the price.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very sexy quality. The fit is accomodating for most small to medium sizes, I bought a size small, for example.. the skirt is a lace up booty corsette. A must have for flirty fashionistas on a lingerie budget.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Looks sexyFits just a little big .Elastic Waste band is a little weak for a garter. I probably should have got a small but chart said medium was what I needed.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Do not expect any kind of support from the top. It looks good with a bra underneath and the skirt was a little odd. It was wide at the top and the same length at the bottom. It was an okay buy but it's not something I tried on and was feeling myself in. But that's just my opinion.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This has got to be one of the most simple but sexiest lingerie outfits I‚Äôve ever gotten! The lace is very dainty and sweet. It fits perfectly and is nice and soft. I can‚Äôt wait to get my boyfriends review ;)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was excited about this set, but the skirt is all bunched up, not to mention it came with it unlaced and was a pain to get it laced up

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My boyfriend loved this, especially with the white stockings you can purchase extra. This looks so perfect and just as advertised. Buy it now you won't regret it!! :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was hesitant to buy this because someone said its not meant for women who have small breast, this is incorrect.It fits me perfectly! I'm a small size.Looks great!

  These are not the real JMZ bras, I used to purchased these here and the material was heavier and solid built, like at the store. These ones are counterfeit, no way JMZ can be selling this thin terrible material bras, they are extremely light in weigh and terrible quality, no wonder people are posting photos of broken ones, and ones that don't fit. Trust me save your money and don't waste it buying these fake ones. They also run smaller than the previous ones I got of the same size. I returned them both.  I am getting tire of vendors in amazon selling fake stuff, Lately I had to return stuff that is no longer original and good quality. Go to the store and purchase them there for original quality. Amazon needs to do something about these vendors selling bad imitation stuff.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  ""Just my size""???? Since when does a DD fit like a B?!?!!! Very dissapointed because i can't even give it away as i don't know anyone that small. Plus , WHO WANTS TO WEAR POINTY SHAPED BREASTS??!! The straps are so short that i have no idea how they expect anyone to actually adjust them smaller. I threw away enough of those failures already and this is one more! 13 bucks isn't much but i wasn't expecting it to be THIS bad!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The cup size is fine but the band is eight inches smaller than what I ordered.  When I called JMS for help to find out how to order the right size the CSR literally began yelling at me to call Amazon and it wasn‚Äôt their responsibility to answer any questions about the product. I hope for her sake she was having an off day as that is one hell of a way to run a company. I let her know this would the last bra I would buying from them and I would be dragging out my sewing machine and learning to sew my own bras going forward.I did call Amazon right after and request a refund.A very nice young man answered the phone and let me know this was his first call ever as an Amazon representative.  He did a much better job on his first call than Just My Size did.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Haven't even owned this bra for 6 weeks and the entire top seam ripped from top to bottom. Now I'm at work with basically half a boob hanging out.This was already a looser fitting bra than I'd like, so it's not like my breast was bursting at the seems. And naturally this happened 2 weeks after the return window ended. Thanks for Nothing Just My Size :-(

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So this is a great price! I was shopping around and trying to find a flattering bra without the expense but found the first one I ordered was too large in the band and rode up my back. I like the coverage and material so I got measured for the proper band and cup and came  back here to order another one in the proper size. I was super excited when I first tried the new one on. It fit so good in the cup area without spilling over, had fully Adjustable straps (so I can hike the girls up further) and it also fit properly on my back on the end clasp (which they say is showing a proper size), HOWEVER by the end of the day the 42F (DDD) girls were so heavy (they are!)  that THIS BAND is also now riding up my back, which  they say shows the band size is too large (but likely just stretched out from the weight of the girls). My final opinion is that 1.) If you have large breasts that you want to be supported higher and always tighten your bra straps then this may NOT be the right bra For you because the back WILL ride up due to the weight up front and the material. 2. If you want a lightweight bra without pinching underwire that does not need much strap adjusting (you are okay with large breasts being much lower, where they started) then this inexpensive bra may work fine for you. It covers well and is comfortable and weighs nothing. Both the larger and proper band size in this bra both rode up my back. The only smaller band size I tried in another brand dug into me so much that it was painful. I feel like I finally have the right size but need a firmer material that stays put. (There‚Äôs a great sister size bra chart online that helps...for example if you wear a 38G and gain a little bit of weight and need a bigger band size, it DOES NOT mean try a 40G, it jeans try a 40F! Crazy right!? Up in band means DOWN  in cup size. Everyone gets so fixated on cup size when it means nothing without the band size. Your ‚ÄúD cup‚Äù could actually mean a B cup in a larger band size! Yes, really! Such an education for me! This is the first time I think I‚Äôm finally in the right size bra and it shows! I highly suggest you measure before ordering and use the sister size bra chart. I still like this bra and wear it when I want comfort and can deal with pulling it down on my back a couple of times a day. If wanting more support for large breasts without riding up,  I suggest a different style.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Just my size makes a very nice bra for women with ample breasts ( I have had a DDD since middle school, and have experienced nearly every style of bra made in my size) They are comfortable for all day wear.***I totally recommend!***However I am so sick of paying premium prices for brassieres!I am also tired of not being able to purchase a  ""pretty"", or  ""cute"" bra for less than $50! It's ludicrous that they all look like workday bras.Every large breasted woman knows exactly what I am talking about!**However I am recommending this particular brassiere based on comfort, and quality of materials used.  ^_~

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  When they arrived the size wasn‚Äôt British size so I thought a mistake had been made. Luckily I checked and the size was right. I can honestly say I‚Äôm pleased with the product.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I have worn this type of bra for years. First brought in Florida many years ago.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great bra, soft and comfortable with good support. Only downside is shoulder straps not stretchy type but saying that i'm a 50dd and it fits and supports me comfortably. Thanks

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Excellent a pleasure to do business with

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This bra sucks. I bought it in my regular size and it was tiny so I sized up and I still don't like it. First of all, there is a weird seam that goes across the breast that ripples and looks like a bulgy nipple through t-shirts and light sweaters. The fabric does not conform to the shape to the breast and gives my bust an odd pointy shape. I was hoping a wear or two would smooth out the shape but nope. All the support from this bra comes from the straps alone. The band does not help support the gals at all. So if your breasts are heavy, guess what? Your shoulders are going to bear all the weight. Ouch! Not only that, it digs into my skin on my back. Boo!

Playtex Women's 18 Hour Ultimate Lift And Support Wire Free Bra,White,40DDD

I have to say that I have finally found the most comfortable bra, for me!!  Everything about it fits great. The straps support so no giggling when walking, plus they don't slip off my shoulders, and the band fits well and doesn't ride up.  The cups are not only pretty but they support very well.According to an article I read about how to measure to find the perfect fit, I may be able to order a 38DDD. The article said that when you fasten a bra when it is new, it should be in the loosest hooks. As the bra wears over time, you then have the other tighter rows to move to so that the bra stays snug.  On this bra I am using the row that is the tightest setting.  I just wish all bras, at least by the same company, measured the same!One small tidbit of information that I learned from this article I thought I would share with you.  Did you know that the cup's actual size is different for each band size?  For instance, for a 40DDD and a 38DDD, not only is the band size 2 inches small but the DDD cups are also a different volume.  A 38DDD's cups are actually a little smaller than a 40DDD.  I thought that was interesting because for 52 years I always thought a cup size (B, C, D, DD, DDD),  was the same size no matter what the band size was.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Good bra. Since I read the reviews, I knew to go up one band size, but I still have it on the loosest hooks. Holds the girls up high and shapes nicely. I'm wearing a very lightweight shirt, and there is no nipple show-through, though it allows a bit of bulge out the sides and back. I definitely recommend.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I wear a size 38DDD and needed a cheap bra I could wear around the house or under some layers - I wasn't in the market for some ultra sexy or that'd give me epic cleavage. This pretty much fits the bill for that type of bra. It's comfortable, it keeps the girls nicely supported, and it was cheap enough that I'm going to be purchasing a couple more. The fabric is nice and actually feels like it's going to last a decent amount of time and not start showing wear that quickly. I would definitely recommend to people like me who can't afford ultra expensive bras all the time and is looking for something to get the job done with no-frills.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  You know your bras are old and so worn out that they no longer hold you up, no matter how much you tighten the straps. This was the case for me since I hadn't bought new bras in YEARS so I decided it was time to invest in some bras. I used to spend a lot of money on each bra from an expensive store (shhh, it's a secret!) and, while I loved them, it didn't seem to be very practical to me if I could find less expensive bras that were good quality and could do just as good of a job. I remember seeing Playtex bras when I was much younger and started searching for them. This seemed to be a popular choice among many people so I chose one of these to test it out.This Playtex bra is an 18 hour bra meant to lift and support all day. It doesn't have an underwire and it's lightly padded on the shoulder straps. The cups aren't padded and there are three hooks for each of the three closure sizes for a total of nine hooks. I purchased the nude color which is a nice, light color that is good for a lot of light-colored and dark-colored clothes. Washing instructions are machine wash cold with like colors and tumble dry low. It is made in El Salvador of 81% nylon and 19% spandex (cup and center belt) and 92% nylon and 8% spandex (back). I always put my bras in lingerie bags in the washing machine and hang them up to dry.For sizing purposes, I am typically a 36D and ordered a 36D in this bra. It fits perfectly so I'd say you will most likely want to order your normal size. This is a full-coverage bra so it goes up a little higher on your chest. I like the fact that it fits me nicely, the straps are padded and comfortable and the design is attractive.The reason I'm not a big fan of this bra is because I don't feel it's very supportive. I usually wear underwire bras and thought I'd try this because it seems to be a popular choice. Even though I tighten the straps, I still feel like I'm drooping because I don't feel the bottom part holds me up enough. I end up adjusting myself several times throughout the day (fortunately, I'm a stay-at-home mom). The other reason I don't really like this bra is because it isn't padded. I don't need a lot of padding but I like some padding to hide the fact that I get cold. It was very easy to see that I was cold when I wore this bra, which my husband was delighted to point out to me.Since this particular bra doesn't suit me well, I ended up purchasing¬†

Playtex Women's Secrets Body Revelations Underwire Bra, Black Jacquard,36D

  ¬†which I LOVE and ordered several of them! I opted to keep this 18-hour bra because I can just use it for when I'm relaxing at home so it will get some use but I don't see myself purchasing anymore of these anytime soon (I'm in my mid-30s so this could change when I get older). I think if you are smaller-chested, this is a good option because it's comfortable, especially if you don't like underwire. I'm bigger on top and prefer padding and underwire so this bra doesn't suit me but others may like it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I want to thank all the full figured ladies who reviewed this and other bras. They are tough customers, and I read closely. I'm a 36B and I must say I appreciate the wide straps that don't fall off my shoulders, the side panels that prevent side bulges, and the semi unlined cups that don't broadcast chilly temps. For the money, I'm quite satisfied with this bra and I think I will buy more. Would like more colors, but I'm ok with what they have right now. Keep reviewing ladies, I learn a lot from you!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I had one of these in dark blue and the bra was great. Then I bought a white one. It simply was like what you see in the photo of this page. The white one is the only one that has those wrinkles (shown by a blue circle). It looks like the outer layer has some extra cloth compared to the inner one that caused the wrinkles. Mine had them on both sides. I tried to fix it but it took some time and it is not perfect. I didn‚Äôt take a picture of mine before fixing it. But found out the seller‚Äôs photo has the issue too, that is why I used it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I order these for my mum who has 4 of them now.  She swears by them saying they are comfortable and wash great with good support and looks nice, not too old lady ish.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Product arrived well package and was as described.  I was disappointed to find that some of the stitching was incomplete.  I chose not to return the item as the product is wearable with this flaw.  Would have preferred to take this up with the seller but no section to respond in.  This is a lovely fit item and would buy again.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It's a very comfortable bra with wide shoulder straps which don't cut into you. For me, the cup is a little generous and consequently does not provide a smooth effect, but that could be my fault for buying the size I always do without checking measurements.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The most comfortable bra I have ever worn. Soft material, really comfortable straps. No nasty wires. and pretty material.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  comfortable bra, firm hold, not flattening, and soft shoulders. Firm grip on the back, and silky smooth.  I like this bra, and will buy more when required.

  I order a size medium fit perfect !!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  VERY stretchy. I definitely could have down sized. I ordered xl. I‚Äôm size 16 around 200lbs. I have about a c chest. If you have a smaller chest or a saggy chest size down. Very comfy. I would highly recommend this

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I used the measurements from the last picture, and it fits perfectly! He's gonna love it!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I really love the color of this babydoll lingerie! Slipping into this was super comfortable, and the material doesn't make you itch. I can sleep very comfortable with this, and this also is very flattering if you want to impress someone. This is definitely something to have in your collection.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits perfect! Love the adjustable straps since my shoulders are tiny. Beautiful color and soft material.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Sexy! Gorgeous color.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  He is going to love it! I love the color and the material is so unbelievably soft!!!üòã It makes me feel very beautiful! 10/10 would recommend.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs amazing!! Comfortable the clasp is easy to undo I love it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 198LBS, ordered an XL but I could have gone with an Large. Otherwise I love it, fabric is soft and doesn‚Äôt tug at my nipple piercings. I love it and my husband loves it. Definitely recommend.No support but if you‚Äôre comfortable with yourself it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So so so beautiful.  For the price this really can't be beat. Super sexy, feels super comfortable. Definitely a worth whole purchase. I would reccomend this to ANYONE. if you have large breasts I would highly recommend ordering a size up. I have a small chest in comparison to my size, and it JUST fit me right. But if my chest were any larger they would be busting out.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  First time buying something like this online and I'm.so happy I took the chance because it's beautiful!I'm 36DD, size large and it fits perfectly....True to size, sexy, comfortable and even if it does not offer any support to your breast it's still very complimenting.Definitely a good buy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered size 3X just because I didn‚Äôt know how small or how the fit would be. I am bigger chested so I got it that size. It fits a bit loose on me but still very comfortable. The texture is very smooth. The underwear I found it poorly made. Too small at the front and the gstring too big lol üòÜ can‚Äôt complain about this as it is very good decent price and also adorable. Though it was a bit too loose on me, it fits perfect n my top area.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This product was tricky for me. Some parts were too big and some too small. The breast cups are too small if you are larger chested. The bra also doesn't offer any support. It flows nicely, but the material isn't the greatest. However, for the price it will do just fine! I just wish it fit better, I followed the size guide perfectly.

  NOT HANES!  I have worn the Hanes Spandex panties for many years.  After having difficulty finding them in stores, I started to buy them from Amazon about 5 years ago.  That worked out well until orders I placed in the last year.  These are thin and not well made at all.  I finally realized these are NOT Hanes.  My real Hanes have the name stamped below waistband at back. They are well made and still look nice.  These recent orders do not have any sort of label other than size and material and country imported from!  They are obviously some  inferior knock off.  This particular order arrived in clear baggie.  There was some dinky ‚Äútag‚Äù that said ‚ÄúBALI‚Äù...I don‚Äôt believe that one either.  I am really upset that Amazon is selling this inferior product under the name HANES!  Cmon!  Hanes are Hanes!  Not what you sent me...and took my money for!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These are not Hanes. I own Hanes panties and they say Hanes on them. These don‚Äôt say Hanes on them, not do they say Hanes on the tag. So I am returning them.

  These run a size small. I bought the 2x.  I wear a size 16.  The 2x fits very well. These offer medium support.  It give a support fitted, but not binding. They fit comfortably everywhere....legs, waist, etc.. The fabric is lightweight and silky.  The come to the natural waist. These are very good basic underwear.I really like these. The give just enough support to feel comfortably held in.  I like the soft silky feel.When you put them on they stay in place. The waist doesn't roll or slide down. I also like the plain simple style. I bought them in every color available.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  do not buy they are awful what a waste of money i am throwing out they run very very small not true to size at all, too bad they do not have zero stars. THEY RUN VERY SMALL I HAD TO THROW OUT SINCE I CANNOT RETURN THEM.  GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I  am delighted to find these light control briefs  once again in the 6X size that has always fit so well. For quite some time now I have not been able to find them up to this size. The quality looks good and they fit the same wonderful way I have always been so comfortable with.The material seems to be good and they are stitched very well. I look forward to seeing how well they hold up with wear and washing. At this time, they seen to be as good as the ones I have purchased for many years now.So good to have them again. They give the light support that I need to keep my back very comfortable.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I like the firmness of the fabric which gives some support for casual wear and that is what I wanted.  My only negative would be that the leg holes are a little tight and by the end of the day you really feel the pressure--not that it cuts into the skin but you feel sore-ish.  I have yet to wear two days in a row in order to give skin some rest.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  They are Bali, not Hanes.  I know Hanes & Bali are the same parent company, but these underwear are not the same as pictured.  They are thinner than the Hanes I've purchased in the past.  They also run a bit small.  They aren't terrible, but definitely not the quality I'm used to with my regular Hanes undies.  Definitely order a size larger than normal.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I received 2 different briefs. One had tags like you would find in the store, the other no tags at all. One was a little smaller than the other and one was lighter in color than the other. They were supposed to be size 4X but I am a size 22/24 and these were way too small. I barely was able to get them up but they had stretched to the max and were so uncomfortable with pinching around leg holes and waist.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  They don't go up high enough and the belly band is tight. The waist elastic slides down which is very uncomforable.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  LOL these are so so so small... I held it up and thought that the waist part was a leg hole. I don't even have to try these on to know that there is no way they will fit. ""Shapewear"", sure, but these are hilarious

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great quality !I am happy that i looked at other reviews and bought a size up !  i usually wear Medium and i bought Large and it fits perfectly !  Luv them ...... very comfortable !

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This item is definitely not 8x..at least not in Canada.

  I did not bother to return the item instead I gave it away because it was not fitting

  I wear a 30FF-G in Panache and as such had gotten so uncomfortable and frustrated with all my bras other than this sports bra, which I had in a bright pink color. I'd started just wearing that one for everyday use as much as I could (as long as it wouldn't show) and decided I needed it in beige so I could wear it under all my everyday clothes. At the time that color didn't exist and I scoured the internet for another bra in my size with this level of support, coverage, and comfy padding. I came up with nothing. I got so excited when I looked on the Panache site and found that they were releasing this wired sports bra in Latte, and checked every bra seller (including Amazon) until I found it being sold. Latte is a great color for every day use - I tried it on under a white t-shirt and it didn't show at all because it's so covering and close enough to my skin color. From the pictures I was worried about the gray stripe along the straps and the Panache logo in the center, but these don't affect the (lack of) visibility of the bra under a shirt - the little gray strip is subtle and actually kind of pretty to me, and the Panache logo is a very light silver.Runs true to size for a Panache sports bra - I ordered my same size as the last one (30FF) and a 30G too and I think I like the fit of the 30FF still - the band is snug but I wouldn't want to go up a band size and risk it being loose at all. Having owned another of these for years, I can tell you they hold up and keep their shape and firmness, like, forever.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So I‚Äôm a 36 DD -I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù 138 pounds.I purchased this because I needed a hook bra and not a pull over. When I tried it on fit nice and I really like the hook that converts the bra to racer back. But as soon as I started running the under wires in the front started cutting into my chest bone. Extremely uncomfortable. Are usually don‚Äôt like underwire bras and haven‚Äôt purchased one for a while but the reviews seem so great. If you‚Äôre midsized but larger bus I would definitely go with the Calia by Carrie underwood. That bra has been the beat sports bra I‚Äôve ever owned

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Finding a sports bra in a 36HH is difficult, and I am thankful to Panache and Amazon for making this bra size available. This is not a bralette for lounging, but also not too, too restrictive, but buying the right size is important - you will pop out if your cup size isn‚Äôt big enough for you, and that doesn‚Äôt have to do with the design of the bra. (I did size up on the back to be able to size down on the cup size, and it worked.) I like that the cup is full on the bottom, which allows for my boobs to sit in the cup, instead of strapping them down (which doesn‚Äôt work) or propping them up (and choking me). Important to note: The clip to convert the bra into a t-back is virtually impossible to clip by yourself once the bra is on. I have practiced yoga daily for years and have very open shoulders, and I cannot clip it, as it is located very far down on the back. Nonetheless, it is essentially one of only options very large busted athletes, and I recommend it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Since i fluctuate between two sizes,i originally purchased this in the smaller size,wanting it to have more support. It felt very supportive and jumping up and down for a few minutes caused no pain so i would say definitely fits what i'm looking for in a bra. However,the band felt too tight,even for a sports bra,and the cup was just right but pretty narrow for me,being on the even-fullness,wider side. I have this problem with a lot of Panache bras. If you don't then you probably won't have this problem with this bra either.I decided to try in a bigger band with the same cup,and in the same band size going one cup up.The bigger band was huge and had a very big difference in cup size despite being the same size (more than usual,i would say a size in a half difference in cup size) so i don't recommend trying this. Try a sister size instead if your size doesn't fit right.The other one came in the wrong size,so i had to return and the replacement was lost in transit so i'm not sure what that would fit like. It was smaller in band and bigger in cup and still felt very supportive although understandably not very comfortable. Despite being the wrong size it still kept things together.I would probably recommend you stick to your smaller size and after a few weeks it should stretch a little with wearing and washing and would probably fit better.Since having a bad experience with this seller i'm not sure i will order again but if i would i would get the first fit that was a little too snug and just get an extender and wait a few weeks for a better fit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Make sure you are buying the right sports bra for the right use. I have bought a few, used a few, tossed a few because I didn't know what I was needing or looking for. What was important to me was high impact support (underwire), work out use only not every day use, comfort, easy to put on and quality.  Make sure you get the right size. Get fitted for your correct bra size! I recently had this done and not only did I have the wrong size, I was wearing them wrong! Yes, you can wear a bra incorrectly. I was told 90% of women do not know their correct bra size and tend to go with a size that's comfortable but not necessarily the right size. This bra has an inseam between the two cups, if you are looking for a uni-bra this is not the one for you. Try bending over when putting this on to make sure the girls are in fully and separated. If they are not, I imagine this could not only be uncomfortable but could put pressure on the seams causing the wires to poke through. Again, wrong size could be the issue too. Even if the bra is too big, wires can move around too much. I love that this fits just like a bra with the optional snap in the back for added support and razorback option.  Easy to do overall. HAND WASH only!  Yes, this bra is not inexpensive. Take delicate care of it. You will not only give your bra longevity but will not damage it during washings. The fabric looks to be of good quality and very durable. I just bought a second one as I am very happy with it and what it is being used for.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  i am a 28 inch chest, and this did come really tight under the bust. so stretched it over the chair back for 2 days. still pretty tight and definitely keeps everything in place while I'm doing sports but I'm aware of the tightness still so dont wear this much. going up a size would make it a bit slack. i was hoping it would slack off but it hasn't. i used to love the secure feeling, if not somewhat clinching but can't wear it anymore as feel like I'm in a straight jacket. IMPORTANT..i think if under the bust is just right... it would be a fine bra, and i am clearly between sizes... the under wiring feels quite an event. i have now opted for underwired bras totally, for breast health and because i think i was obsessed about my breasts staying some ideal shape...as I've relaxed i notice everyone else has relaxed around me...

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love this bra and love the price! Would definitely buy again and in other colours. Ventured online after trying 4 bras in M&S and finding that none of them fit! I almost bought a bigger size but thankfully went with my true size and it was a great fit!It makes my boobs look great and doesn't have the effect of crushing my boobs like some sports bras do. I even wear it as an everyday bra sometimes.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  After much experimentation with sizes this one fitted. However it was totally unsupportive. I would just go for your regular bra size and see how that goes. Its tricky to get on anyway.  Nice looking bra and as lots of people say - avoids the dreaded monoboob but frankly I would settle for the monoboob if the actual bra was supportive enough

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bought the second one on amazon as it is basically impossible to find this brand/product where I live: just perfect, not only for sports (if you have a small frame and a big bust this is a must-have) but also under everyday clothing.Eased a lot of my usual back and neck pain, fits wonderfully -- I wend down a band size and up a cup size for perfect fit: maybe a slightly bigger cup would have been better, but as I wanted to use this bra for running a snug fit is a plus.The silicone-encased wires are unbelievably comfortable and the shoulder straps don't dig in, as the weight is perfectly supported by the band and cups. However, the racerback option for maximum support during high impact activity is a wise choice -- do not expect zero movement, though: a very slight bounce will be there anyway. Wish amazon sold the matching shorts in size 8!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Good sports bra. Slightly boosts my already large bosom but not too comedic. Holds everything where it should be even with high impact aerobics. I'm personally not keen on the hook at the back to make it a cross type but you don't have to use this feature and it is quite easy to clip or unclip the crossed straps.

  They fit perfect I bought these to add a little something to bedroom fun. They fit well for me and I‚Äôm 180 lbs 5‚Äô4 and no complaints

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  High quality, LOVE these.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These are nice and comfortable, and they look great. The rubber in the lace top hasn't let them slip off of my legs, which is also really nice. I'm definitely getting more of these.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These thigh highs are as soft as they are sexy! They fit me very well and the rubber lining around the top keep them snugly in place. The rubber lining on these has not irritated my skin like some of the other brands have done in the past. Will definitely be a repeat buyer. Recommended!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am THICK and Muscular, finding anything to fit around my thighs is a pain. These fit better than any product I've bought before. They did NOT roll down, but that doesn't stop me from worrying about it and checking it often. They do not come. With the garter belt pictured so be sure to actually read the description before buying on a impulse like most shoppers do!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great product but I did have to pull them up pretty frequently and I have larger thighs. Super sexy though

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  will definitely order again (i accidentally snagged them with my nails). great fit, they stay up well, and they are sexy as hell.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Terrible quality meant that after wearing for just 4 hours there were holes appearing in the fabric. At first they looked really pretty and not a little sexy though, so I was very disappointed to have wasted ¬£13+ on them. Don't waste your money, girls! Holly x

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Comfy sexy and pink, what more could you ask for!The silicone top works well.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  very bright but nice and soft

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great, make my wife look brillant.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The first pair I ordered fit perfectly and stayed up all day with no snags or runs and I was so happy I ordered a second pair -- which promptly got a giant run from somewhere around my ankle/heel area (while wearing plush slipper booties, no less) and the other one kept slipping down to my calf the whole day! Hopefully the first pair I ordered will hold up at least one more wear to make them almost worth the price.

  First,  they come up way too high, as in Easily go almost to crotch level, without stretching.  SECOND-  while the image shows the bar of darker material below the lace top,  I really didn't notice when buying, but in person its UGLY. Unfortunately,  I missed the return window by 2 DAYS.... As I haven't been able to try on till now (This is for a surprise for my husband, for a boudiore session... since he works from home and is always home, I only now thought got to try on because he's on a trip.Anyway,  I finally got to try on and they are terrible.  Bummed as I'm now out the money for an item I'll never wear. And because of 2 days. Grr... Anyway, I don't reccomend because of the reasons expressed. Oh and they're too soft, as in NO support or licra.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These stockings are fine for what they are intended for...fun in the bedroom. The lace top is nice. There is no rubber on the inside to keep the stockings up...you absolutely need a garter belt (which is not included). I am 5'8"" and these fit fine. If you are short, these probably won't work for you unless you have big legs. They do seem to stretch out a bit. In the future, I will buy stockings with the rubber at the top to help it stay up, even with a garter.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These were very cute and sexy for five minutes. They fit my legs but the material is nylon like panty hose. After wearing them for a bit, the stockings would not stay up. By the end of the night, i gave up pulling them up and they sat around the top of my boots on my shins. If i hadn't been wearing boots im sure they would have been around my ankles.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  There is no ""stick"" to keep them up and they only stretched to mid thigh. Had to take them off and throw them away during my dinner date.  I'm 5'2 150 pounds size 6/7.  One size fits most should fit me. Waste of money and embarrassing.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I wasn't sure how these would fit me, since they're ""one size"". But I'm 5'2"" and 120 lbs. and they fit just right! They're also higher quality than I expected. In the past I've always bought from Victoria's Secret but now I'm glad I found these. Much better price!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These stockings look great and are at such a great price. The deciding factor for me is that they don't have the silicone bands that help them stay up. I didn't want the silicone because I wanted to use these in combination with a garter belt, where I thought the silicone would get in the way. The stockings worked great!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  They‚Äôre super cute and gets the job done so they are definitely worth the price. I ordered mine to wear with a garter anyway so it didn‚Äôt matter that they didn‚Äôt stay up too well.. lol

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These are very nice, but they need to be sized better, because a petite woman cannot wear these. I'm 5'2, and I had to flip the lace tops down. They were still a bit long.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was waiting on these to be delivered as I had tried those that have the build in stocking and suspenders, these are so much nicer, as you can see from the photos they are very nicely designed, yes I needed to shave the top of my legs, done that now:)If you're looking for something to spice up your life, go for it, what have you got to lose.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  they look pretty and feel soft, but the elastic does NOT go beyond a size 12 thigh, it looks like my leg is bulging out over the top of it

  I'm actually mad at this thing.  MAD.  Hey bra manufactures?  Are you reading this?  I already have so much boob I can't fit into most regular store bras, and if I'm on Amazon I'm desperate to find a specialty foundation garment that will hold my junk together.  And if I'm buying this size, the LAST effing thing I need is a bra that SAYS it's for larger women but it really just has giant pillows of padding!!  Come ON!  I don't need ""uplifting"" PADDING!!  Translation - a bra to make smaller boobs look bigger.  Dude, I have more boob then I can stand, I don't want them BIGGER, I need to strap by junk down so I don't fall out of my dress or look like the girls hang to my knees.  And this is the best you people can come up with?  Cheaply made extra super super padded ""cups"" with elastic that doesn't lay flat, doesn't hold you down, and doesn't lift you up?I am at my wits end on what bra I can wear for a very formal dress I have, but this is ridiculous this trash is being made and sold at all.  Save your money and just buy a new dress where you can wear a normal bra.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Hi,I purchased this bra to wear with a deep v cut bodysuit/shirt. I am attaching pictures of me in my regular bra with the top and the Maidenform Women's Sexy Plunge Convertible Bra-Fully Adjustable bra in the top. I think the bra is great and pretty supportive. The quality of the material is good. Both straps are detachable, and the inner lining is soft, a little flimsy but you don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre going to slip out. It also comes with a thin plastic band that is stretchy and comfortable but still kind of poor quality. There is an underwire to keep the U or Plunge shape and it feels study enough. I can‚Äôt keep this bra or give it 5 stars is because of the overall fit. If I needed the bra for a different shirt of dress, even though it‚Äôs a little substandard, it still is sturdy enough for me to feel supported. It kind of gets the job done. But as you can see it is visible for my outfit and that isn‚Äôt going to work for me. The cups don‚Äôt have weird or awkward padding which is nice.My normal bra size is 32DDD or 32DD depending on the brand. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4.5‚Äù and 160lbs. I purchased this bra in the (S/T : 4)  I‚Äôll keep looking for a bra but good luck to everyone else looking! I heard the Fine Lines Plunge Bra is great so I'll be trying that Next!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am a 38F/G depending on the brand. A little too big for the Victoria Secret DDD. My measurements are 45"" around the bust and 38"" band and waist. I got a size 13. It fits great. I usually use the halter option and haven't tried it with other strap methods but it works great and holds well. Halter strap can dig a little bit but that's to be expected with how much it has to hold! Wore it with a low cut top (pictured above) and with the help of a single safety pin to get the top to stop shifting around (not the bra's fault) you couldn't even see the bra underneath!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5‚Äô6, 145lbs and have a bust size of 34DD.  I ended up purchasing the size ‚Äú6‚Äù because I can also wear 36D bras.  Being a larger busted woman I was pretty skeptical about purchasing this‚Ä¶but I really needed a bra for my deep plunging gown.  I was pleasantly surprised trying it on!  The support level was completely acceptable and I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúpop‚Äù out, so it definitely works for someone with a larger chest! Definitely beats buying a deep plunge bra with the adhesive sides lacking support, I love the straps!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This brought work perfect for what I needed. I altered my wedding dress to be deep plunge and needed a bra that would not show but keep the girls upright. I am a 42 DDD Lane Bryant bra. You will need to wear it with something form-fitting for that extra support.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This was purchased for my wife with a purpose in mind.  She had a beautiful long dress that she wanted to wear to New York City when we went to see a show.  The issue was that the dress was very low in the back.  She didn't have a bra she could wear that would not show in the back.We figured we'd have to pin this bra to the dress to make it work, but we were wrong.  My wife was able to adjust this bra in such a way that the bra did not show at all with her dress.  It was such a beautiful dress, but it would look wrong if you could see the bra, and it would look wrong to wear without a bra.This purchase fixed everything and my wife, like always, looked stunning.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love the versatility of the bra, with low drop back converter strap, covers most of my breasts. (42DD) About 3 inches of side boob is left. Ordered a size up because I read that it was small and happy I did. It comes with a transparent halter strap attached as well. I needed it for my wedding and reception dresses, with deep plunge necklines and it looks perfect. 4 stars vs. 5 because of the 3 inches of side boob.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was looking for a deep plunge bra to enable me to wear the odd plunge dress or top but still have support. I'm a 34g so finding bras can be difficult at the best of times however I'm familiar with this brand as house of Fraser stock it.I ordered this and received it within 3 days. It's a lovely thick quality bra and comes with 1 clear halter strap and 2 black straps so can be worn different ways to suit your outfit which is great. I did find the cups run quite small, they are very narrow just hiding the essential part. As the fabric of the bra is quite thick I did find that it made them look quite pointy. Overall with a bit of adjusting I could make this work for a night out so it could do the job with certain outfits.I looked on the maidenform website for a size guide and for the larger breasted ladies like me I was advised a size 7 would fit. So I suggest looking on there to get an idea if you're unsure

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Sorry not for me. Had to return. Just about did the job I bought it for - strapped dress with hole between the bust - but just felt very awkward and uncomfortable. More of a flap on strings than a bra.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The cup is tiny and not suitable for the larger chest as it does not cover enough.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The fit and comfort was disappointing

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Worst bra I've ever bought in my entire life. It's really a joke. It will not hold anything less than perky silicone ladden boobs. Waste of money and time.

  I‚Äôm really disappointed in these.First, Amazon says they fit true to size, but when I got them in size 9, they said 9/2XL on the tag! How is 9 a 2XL?? They‚Äôre definitely a lot bigger on me than I wanted them to be, but given the next complaint I have, idk if a smaller size would fit me either.The biggest issue with these is that the front panel is identical to the back panel. In order to avoid a plumber‚Äôs crack, I have to wear them all the way up, as much up in my business as a thong. Simultaneously, the front panel bunches up when I put the butt part where it actually fits. So I can‚Äôt wear them with leggings at all.All in all, these are poorly designed and hella mislabeled. I‚Äôm really disappointed and am considering returning them. :(

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Wish I had read the reviews first. I love this style and have many like it, but these are way too big, have no elasticity, and just fall off. The legs are also too wide and loose. It‚Äôs not a look at a all.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  There is no elasticity in this product. It looks great when I put it on, fits just as described. Within minutes, it starts to creep off my body and slide down front and back and sits rolled up on my inner  thighs. The lack of elasticity means your normal size will quickly turn into an undie nightmare!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  ...yet, no matter how beautiful it is, or well constructed, if it doesn't fit, those things don't matter. I'm a size 18, fairly well proportioned, yet still typically pear shaped. If you are of a similar size but you're shape is larger in the bust and shoulders, these might be great for you, and I would recommend them. That said, I followed the sizing guide and this panty too small to be close to comfortable.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  They are beautiful and well-made. I love the color and lace pattern. Very pretty! For me, the crotch and fit are quite uncomfortable. I don't wear thongs, but regular panties, so maybe i'm just not used to this style. Can't wear them. I have a large derriere, so maybe they are comfortable if one's bottom is not full.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5ft 34‚ÄùWaist 135lbs , with pudgy stomach & slim posterior.  I liked the softness of lace at this price.  Crotch area is lined but there is a stiff long tag that i could see being a problem if worn more than a interlude.  I didnt buy these to hav on all night.  I am pleased with lace garment on sale under 5.00.  Retail priced , i would shop a bit & pay bit more.  Well made however.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These were SO uncomfortable. I put them on and about an hour later, I took them off and put them in the trash. Constantly riding up, shifting, and moving around. Its insanely uncomfortable. Avoid.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Cute, but the placement of the cotton liner varies dramatically. And it's small.Kinda makes them miserable to wear and defeats the purpose of underware.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm a size 6 though I can usually wear an 8 too in underwear, these (in a small) are no where near fitting flush on my body. My waist is 25inches and my hips maybe 34 inches. They look several sizes to big, perhaps would work great for someone curvier maybe more 8-10 +. On the pro side, the fabric feels nice and it would be flattering if it fit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These are cute and comfy undies (Maidenform Womens Standard Casual Comfort Cheeky Boyshort). The lace isn't scratchy at all. The seams don't show through pants.I think these are sized slightly larger than expected. I also note that they offer zero stomach support (they aren't advertised to be, but just note there is zero). This is good from a comfort perspective - they're really freeing - but they don't hold you in at all. Also, these are definitely ""cheeky"" boyshorts - they don't offer full coverage in the back, again as the product listing states. These are a little expensive for just one pair of underwear, but they do appear to be well-made, and nicely lined in the gusset. Pretty good but I probably won't be buying another pair.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Ein Artikel, der m.E. bestenfalls bei Gr√∂√üe 36, max. 38,  noch gut aussehen kann. Die Form ist irgendwie ""aus der Form"" geraten. Aber nat√ºrlich macht ""Gefallen"" sch√∂n. Ich w√ºrde diesen Artikel nicht noch einmal kaufen, obwohl ich ein Fan von ""Maidenform"" bin und bereits andere Artikel sehr oft gekauft habe.

  J'ai pris ce bas pour qu'il soit assorti au SG.Probl√®me de taille : je l'ai pris en T 40 alors que la plupart de mes sous v√™tements sont e 38 et d'autres en 40.A savoir : je n'aime pas √™tre serr√©e dans mes bas de sous v√™tements.Dans cette taille : je flottais dedans.R√©sultat : moi qui n'aiment pas acheter de la lingerie d√©sassortie : je n'ai pas trouv√© de 38 assorti au SG m√™me dans d'autres formes = j'ai renvoy√© le bas et le haut.

  Fits nicely. The straps to stockings were so long though I had to sew them and make them a lot smaller ( they could have attached to ankle socks they‚Äôre that long!) but other than that a sexy outfit for a good price! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 130 pounds. I ordered medium would maybe order small next time.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I LOVE it! I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and about 155, proportional shape, and boobs 36C. I bought a medium and almost could have done a small. I would say the only con is that the garter belt is super long! I have to cut and sew them or go back for the over the knee or knee highs. But I still love it üòçüòçüòç

  Pretty and sexyyy. Only thing is I thought it came with stockingsü§î mine didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs okay though, I really am pleasantly surprised with this product!

  Love this 1

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  First of all the info on my order is incorrect I ordered the navy blue,size xxl. Fit amazing, I‚Äôm 5;7,190/200lbs,38/40DD. Got this in February and worn it and washed it many times, have had no problems. There is not any support in the cups and if you‚Äôre bigger than a DD they won‚Äôt fit good or at all. The material is so soft, kinda like t shirt material,but not,if ya know what l mean? Just really silky feeling and not being silk, thong is of same material, soooo soft. The lace details are not itchy at all, most of the cups are just the lace. That‚Äôs one reason I like this item so much. The garters are a little long, nothing that a little cut-n-sew can‚Äôt fix. Straps and garters are adjustable. Overall another great product from Avidlove, don‚Äôt debate if you want it or not, just try it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Absolutely loved this for a photo shoot. Fit beautifully, great quality, sexy and comfortable.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I like everything about this piece. I buy and own a lot of lingerie. I average about 40+ pieces a year. I like the fit, the style, the material and the finishings of this piece. I could've gone with a smaller size but I rather order larger than too small. I can always sew it in an inch or so. I am 5'10"" 187LBS. 40DDD and big butt. This is going to be one of my favs ‚ù£üëô.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was skeptical because of price but I was so wrong MUST BUY you won't regret it I am 5'5 &195lbs and i feel always very insecure with lingerie and this right here had me feeling so good i tried it on right away as soon as it delivered and I'm in love with it can't wait to get my makeup done hair done and send some pictures to my hubby I bought it  at 6pm and it arrived at 5:30am not even 12 hours later!!!  If you ever feel insecure with your stomach this is for you after 6 kids my stomach hangs bad and my boobs sags and this hid everything in a sexy way!!!

  LOVE! Smooths out tummy great as well as hiding it and flatters curves so well! i will for sure order another one it is so sexy and soft and very stretchy! if you are thinking about buying it trust me its worth it! im 230 lbs 5‚Äô5 but my stomach is small for my size

  I loved it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love it. As a girl with a belly I was kind of nervous about if I'd look like a busted can of biscuits in this boy was I wrong!! Looks an feels great I will say with if you wear a Womens 14 I would go with an XL just because YES it does strech buttttt not a lot. I myself am I between an 12 an 14 depending on the brand an I got a L but XL mite have been just a little better but the L still looked great! If anything the L helped ""the girls"" perk up. An that's another thing I'm a 38 DDD/F and it worked perfect the V pattern an the halter string help the perk up. Hope this helps

  I‚Äôm 205lbs and this stretches to fit my curves and my thick figure. I like it a lot. At first It looks small but, ‚Äúgirls it will fit just about anyone‚Äù.

  Sexy lingerie even for plus size ladies. I'm a 20-22 and bought the 22 it's a little snug getting it on but very cute. Will buy other colors

  I was a lil worried pulling it.out of the pkg it looked way to small ...but after putting it on DAMN I was feeling it. I didn't look like a busted can of biscuits...I was looking GOOD!!!!!! I did go up a size I'm normally and XL and I got a XXL!!!! Big girls BUY this you won't be disappointed I promise!!!!!

  Looks just like the picture and good quality. Did not tear when I put it on. I just don‚Äôt have the figure for it.

  No, you don't get to see a picture of my wife wearing this lingerie, but take my word for it, this is well worth the money. It's sexy without being slutty (well, maybe a little slutty), it looks great, feels great, and is easily removed either slowly or in somewhat of a rush. Do yourself (or your husband) a favor and pick one up today. Actually, for the price, get 2, you can never go wrong with more. :-)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The material is very soft and comfy and both pieces are very cute. It's ties in the front between the breasts, which I didn't notice before ordering but it's fine. My only complaint is that it leaves a large empty gap between my breasts that makes my chest look flatter. I'm going to do some sewing to adjust, since I can't simply grow larger breasts to fill in the cups and pull it closer lol. Overall though, very nice

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not the most flattering when you have somewhat of a pooch belly. I purchased this thinking it was kind of a peekaboo belly and instead my whole stomach was exposed. Great material though beautiful color. I ended up gifting it to my sister she loves it it fits her perfectly.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My husband loved this on me, there wasn't a ton of support for your chest but its not like it was on very long. Super cute.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bought of a girlfriend. But didn't have a chance to give it to her. So not sure how they fit. Are look on her. But the price is ok. Maybe I will find a girlfriend to give it to some day.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I purchased a XXL. The color is very nice and vibrant but it‚Äôs definitely not like advertised. When tied shut it still shows my stomach and doesn‚Äôt really hug the girls like advertised. While I can make this piece work for me, I feel like this piece is more for women with perky breast.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This item has lots of pretty colors to choose from.  I have a couple of them.  This item fits well and is very sexy.  Not only is it hot!, it is very comfortable to wear.

  I wanted to do a boudoir photo session for my hubby so I thought you'd would be cute! I'm 5'4 and 200pds and normally a large in everything but I thought I'd go up a size and now I wish I would've gone up another size. My boobs won't fall out of the sides but they do pop out a bit. The shorts fit as well but they are just a bit tight and ride up. The robe is nice and fits too but it doesn't have belt loops as stated in other reviews.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very cute set! I'm 5'5, 198lbs, size large. Shorts are pretty snug, like zero breathing room lol. The bralette fits perfectly. Love the robe, came with a tie but the ribe doesn't have any loops for the tie... that was disappointing.Very soft, silk like material, this green is beautiful! Will purchase again but a size larger than normal.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  In this set there are so many pieces you get your money's worth. The color was perfect for my skin tone and all the accessories were cute. The satin is thin and soft but doesn't collect static as you wear it. It has a silky texture on the skin and the lace and elastic trims are soft and comfortable. The bralet has adjustable straps and the piece along with the underwear has a lot of stretch. I ordered a size small and it was a little big, but not too bad. The underwear has no panty lining.... and the robe has no belt loops but other than that it was a fantastic buy. The shorts are high waisted and cheeky style. The fabric can be easily ironed on low setting. Fabric for shorts and robe are 90% Polyester and 10% Spandex. All edges are rolled hems finished with surging. You can machine wash it, but I suggest a gentle hand washing and hang drying. Made in China. Pretty good quality for a low price. I'll most likely order a few more in different colors!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was surprised how much I liked this! I didn‚Äôt expect much for the quality, but it‚Äôs silky and soft and sooo cute. It‚Äôs nice to lounge around in. The lace top fit me well, bottoms too (I ordered medium). The only minor complaint would be the odd bulge that the shorts tend to create at the front when your body is in a certain pose... it can look I guess a little unappealing for photos. But that‚Äôs about it, all else I love about this set!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Okay it‚Äôs cuteHowever everything fit except the shorts.Which I find interesting.The shorts are way too small they are like a size x-large I couldn‚Äôt get them to my knees and everything else I bought same size fits perfectly fine.They definitely did not size the shorts correctly I‚Äôm sad because this was for my bday gathering and I can‚Äôt even wear the shorts.Huge disappointment.If you are full figured I recommend going a couple sizes up because I went one size up and still the shorts only is entirely to small.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Item looks just like the picture. I ordered a small but it is still EXTREMELY too big! Ladies if your petite I‚Äôd advise you to gain weight or not order product lol. Other than the product being overly too big, it is perfect

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Definitely glad I read the reviews. You definitely want to size up or 2. I‚Äôm a large at 5‚Äô7 and 180lbs and the xxl fit perfect. Top is completely sheet but everything fit perfectly. Beautiful material. I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments. Love lounging around the house in this

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super pretty color and the medium fit perfect (: Robe is a little funny and the top is just a piece of lace with straps. Expected quality for only $23üëçüèª

  So unless you‚Äôre a model with a boob job, don‚Äôt expect it to fit like the pictures. I‚Äôm 5‚Äù1, 128lbs 34D bra (Victoria secret) 26inch waist. I couldn‚Äôt even wear the panties. If you have any type of lower belly (had kids) then it squeezes tightly there creating bulges. Not flattering, at all. So I just put on some of my own black panties. Garter belt was great! Love it! Top bunched up under my boobs and had to keep pulling it down. Idk...maybe I should have ordered a Medium.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I Ordered a 12 to 14 I sized up. I am 5‚Äô8 8 A 36DD. Top is 40,  waist 33 and hips are 43. I‚Äôm pretty evenly proportioned. The panties were a little tight but they fit. I like a looser fit where they sit on you and don‚Äôt go in at all.The top was extremely elastic I had to tighten it all the way and it was then it fit perfect. And the belt was fine. There are no issues with it the color was nice and it all matched. All in all a good buy for the price.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very flattering! Too revealing for me to post a pic but worth the purchase, made me feel sexy and angelic. I‚Äôm a chubbier girl and it did dig in a bit on my love handles so I‚Äôd say size up.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fit as expected, was exactly as pictured, and only had one one issue. One of the pieces of the harder belt that is supposed to snap to the leggings was sew on backwards. So it was a defective. But I didn‚Äôt have time to send it back and order another unfortunately or I would‚Äôve.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Saw on another review that one of the clips was not on. I gave it the benifit of the doubt. I opened mine up and sure enough, they are very cheap and one was already broken. Had to do photo shoot with a ""wardrobe malfunction"" top fits as expected. Thong is large. Middle piece is small.

  This gave me a confidence I did not know I had!! It looks so good on! It‚Äôs not really a revealing babydoll in comparison to others, but I does have a sexy high slit. Definitely felt very sexy in this. I already recommended it to friends, definitely a must buy!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great quality! Super soft and very comfortable and sexy omg. I was nervous because I‚Äôm more curvy and I wear a size H bra!!! Yeah, typically I am a large in most things I wear but a XL up top and M-L at the bottom so I bought the XL and it‚Äôs fits wonderfully and has a lot of stretch and flows great! I could‚Äôve probably even went a size down. I‚Äôm shocked and sooo satisfied. I will def be buying the other styles.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bought this attire for my wife to wear in the boom boom room! Let me first say how amazing my beautiful wife looks in anything but I decided on this one because she is definitely that ‚Äúcat lady‚Äù and the leopard print seemed to be right up her alley! As soon as my eyes saw her I was like an old Tom cat roaming the neighborhood for some action and I had found my prize! Animal instinct took over and the mating ritual began! It was hot and heavy and there was definitely purrs to be heard! Suddenly I heard her gasp and then yell in a way that I haven‚Äôt heard in action before. Suddenly I realized she was under attack‚Ä¶.. Keep in mind I told you earlier that she is indeed a ‚Äúcat lady‚Äù‚Ä¶ well obviously in the heat of the moment we didn‚Äôt secure the door to the boom boom room and her flock of felines had gathered around to see what all the commotion was about. Then it hit me‚Ä¶. She is being attacked by her own cats because this attire had fooled them all together! In their eyes she wasn‚Äôt their human at this point, she was a unknown feline and they were there to attack! They slashed, bit, and gouged at her in attempt to destroy the intruder of their home! Suddenly the shock wore off and I sprung into action! The first casualty was her youngest Siamese because he seemed to be doing the most damage. One swift swipe to the throat with the Samurai sword I swindled from the renaissance fair left young jo-jo limp on a blood soaked duvet as his head was no longer a part of him! Then half of the gang turned their attention to me because they knew that this had become war! I took a row of scratches from patches right below my left eye before I was able to subdue him with the rear naked choke. My wife was torn between her love for her cats and her own survival at this point. The proverbial ‚Äúrock and a hard place‚Äù but she knew she must fight to survive! She kicked Pee-wee with so much might his departure from the battle was probably quick and painless (or that‚Äôs what I tell my wife to ease her guilt) and then it was down to us against the childrens cat‚Ä¶. Spongefield (named as a settlement between the two names that were finalists to keep peace) old Spongey had seen the demise of his whole brigade but he fought till the end like a valiant soldier. Several blows with a Doc Martin finally eased his mind and the battle was over. My wife and I were treated for several lacerations and have the scars to prove it. It was a learning experience for sure and although we steer clear of the predator prints now, 5 stars was warranted for its realistic appearance.,, and man did my wife look amazing with her beautiful bruised and bleeding body in her shredded lingerie in the emergency room!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm seven months pregnant but ordered down a size for the BOOM factor. This little negligee did not disappoint. The tightness provides excellent breast support for these swollen knockers, and the sleek, stretchy fabric hugs my bonus curves seductively. The side slits and leopard print make it extra racy. Plus it‚Äôll look even sexier once I lose the baby weight. A+ from my husband as well ;-)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Would highly recommend, great product, great fit, true to size!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered this for a boudoir photoshoot and it‚Äôs so cute and soft. The only thing is that the slip on the sides is higher up than it appears in the photos. It‚Äôs also a bit tighter than expected but in all its decent to use for a photoshoot.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Definitely size up, it does not fit what it says.

  So I was able to wear the XXL as a typical us women‚Äôs 18 and 40 D chest, but the top in particular was too small in the cups. It just looked like a miniature triangle bikini top that I was often just popping and falling right out of. It got annoying for sleeping as if you toss or turn at ALL it‚Äôs all turned around and not even on the top but sideways on your top and you are yanking at it and grumbling.Even when not sleeping, but just walking around a hotel room and doing a few random things like pouring wine, etc I was just constantly adjusting the chest like it was pulling my attention away from the moment and annoying me.I tried to sleep in the set and it wasn‚Äôt terribly comfy. I didn‚Äôt feel the need to change our of discomfort, but it‚Äôs not a piece I would choose to actually sleep in again.While I will probably wear it again, it will be a much more limited use to a quick dressing up type of use rather than something I could lounge in to do makeup or even choose to sleep in.The bottoms that are included are also sort of minimal, but not really comfy or super stretchy. I found them to be unflattering bottoms in the way they looked on my plus size (like they were creating rolls) and I wouldn‚Äôt wear them at all outside of the one first try as an outfit. In the future I may even skip these bottoms all together and just use another black set that‚Äôs more flattering or comfier.I will say though that I‚Äôve had bad luck with the color dye in certain internet lingerie and nightgowns and with this piece I didn‚Äôt have that problem at all. There were no rubbing or wearing off onto crisp white sheets and no issues with washing it later.I also liked the way the middle flares out generously around the midsection. I felt like it was a flattering design shape for a bit of a mom bod/ postpartum type of midsection, as its not straight like a sheath or a minidress style.Overall I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it and probably wouldn‚Äôt get it again, just because I feel like there are better designs for a large chest than the way this looked and functioned when on. It could still totally work for a smaller and flatter individual though. I think if you like the fit of a tiny triangle bikini top this could still be a super cute option.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Soft, stretchy, flowy, and lovely.  This negligee fits perfectly and flatteringly, creating a very sexy, feminine look.  The pink version has an especially fairy-like quality.  It has a much more delicate, yet playful, appearance.  The garment is so comfortable on, lightweight and smooth against the skin.  The bottoms straps do roll a bit oddly, but they are fairly easy to smooth back into place.  Really pretty, very worth it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These fit relatively well on my ample body and looked reasonably good considering.

  They tear very easy. Needs more streach for a one size fits all I'm on the smaller size at 5'4 and no more then 145 and it was to snug going over the knee. But I loved the designs and the were unexpectedly quite comfortable

  The feet parts of the sock do not fit a normal foot but if you had a cylinder block. The rest of the outfit was great so I wish it wasn‚Äôt that way, but if your partner isn‚Äôt a feet person then these are really great!

  Super cute and sexy.

  ‚ÄúFits all sizes‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt fit all sizes. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 135. The bottoms wouldn‚Äôt fit over my booty and the rest of the outfit was way too tight. Material wasn‚Äôt good. It ripped when I was just trying to put it on. Waste of money

  As a party of the itty bitty titty committee I am always looking for something that will transform my prepubescent looking boy body to the 20 year old woman I actually am. After looking at the price of this bra, I could not help but buy it. I am between an A and a B, it's a hard life finding bras. This one is truly the best push up bra I have ever bought though. It is a tad small but I feel like if I went to a B it would be too big. I am overall satisfied with this purchase, especially for the price. Anyone looking for an extra lift for a great price should buy this bra.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Switching from VS Very Sexy Bombshell to this bra. Great fit and perfect for someone looking for a boost (I‚Äôm a small B).I‚Äôve been wearing VS‚Äôs Very Sexy Bombshell Add-2-Cup Push-Up Bra for YEARS! Finally got sick of paying $69 for a bra so decided to give this on a try and I‚Äôm in love!Wish they would make more colors/designs

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I have been small chested my whole life and breastfeeding 2 children certainly did them no favors. But, this bra actually fits and gives me the illusion of having breasts. I'm an A cup 5'6"" and 120lbs and the 32A fits perfectly. This bra gives me a nice rounded shape and looks great under shirts. There are no gaps and I actually even get a bit of cleavage. I had to return 3 different bras before finding this one. I'm glad the search is over!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is and has been my most favorite bra for about 4 years now I haven't found a better more comfortable bra! After getting sober I got some boobs and boy does this bra give my girls a boost and it makes me feel sexy and confidant. They wash and dry very well so they last a long time, but even if they didn't at this price you still can't go wrong! :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  When I looked at these reviews I thought everyone was exaggerating the thickness of padding... they weren't. This is the thickest bra I've ever owned and I love it. I get so insecure with my appearance. I'm usually a 36C but due to some reviews I got a 40C and it fits perfectly. I'm no longer a member of the itty bitty titty committee.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I always bought another brand at Kohl's. (Lily of France Ego boost) This bra is even better. Not only is this 1/2 the price, it is much more comfortable. I am a small ,barely 34B , okay maybe even smaller.  I always get a 34b. I need all the push up I can get.  It gives a nice smooth appearance under tops and the underwire is comfy. Also, the lace is soft and not itchy at all as I am very sensitive. I am getting another one asap.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Way way way too much. It was like strapping a second cheat on. Looking for a push up not a bombshell. Otherwise quality is fine but definitely not what I wanted. If they had a different styled bra or size I‚Äôd try buying again from them because like I said the quality is good I will just have to figure out how good the return process is or how difficult it will be to return, because I look like I strapped on a second chest.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love this bra! So yes, it gives you a definite boost, which means this will be more reserved for going out & not so much as an every day bra for me just because its such a big difference from my other ones. I feel like its totally obvious. Its more how the bra was made than the padding. I'm a good C cup. But after 2 kids the girls started to sag so they need a little pick me up. Add that to the fact I don't want people to be able to tell when I'm cold & I usually go for a push-up, padded option. The cups on these are large in that they cover a large area. They still fit great & in fact its the 1st push up bra I have where I dont feel like I'm going to pop out at any moment. It is a lil snug around the waist though, even though I ordered my usual size (36 C).  But its not so bad that its terribly uncomfortable. I would buy again.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am a size 38 C, this bra has so much padding my breasts look 3x bigger than they are. The bra squeaks and makes noise when I move because it is so dense.I could honestly get punched in the breast and not feel a thing.It does fit and it somewhat comfortable but the padding is rediculous.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Lifted those flapjacks into place. Satisfied.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Too much padding. I look like dolly Parton. Its laughable. I should have read all the reviews first. Looking at the model and knowing what I got thru post. She must be a Betty 2 backs.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  There‚Äôs far to much padding don‚Äôt like them but it eas ridiculous how much to send back so had to keep them

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Ordered one of these bras out of isolation desperation!  Up until now, I have been a pretty loyal La Vie en Rose shopper but was unable to purchase my regular choice of bra on line.  I was somewhat skeptical that a bra at half the price I normally pay would be comparable.  Was I WRONG!!!  It's perfect!  In fact I like it so much I've ordered 2 more!  Quality of workmanship is as good or better that the higher priced ""mall stores"".  Fit is smooth and looks great under all my clothes.  I would highly recommend!

  Soft and comfy. I recommend sizing up, I‚Äôm a size 6 and medium is a bit small. The blouse threads are very flimsy and the top ripped after wearing it to bed twice.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Quality is about what I‚Äôd expect for this cost from Amazon (not as soft or delicate fabric as if you‚Äôd get a similar item from a department or lingerie store). The big thing is that I noticed blue discoloration under my arms after wearing it. Sure enough - I soaked the set in water and the water turned blue!  Just beware when washing with other colors the first time‚Ä¶ or with light colored sheets!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These pajamas are completely see through. They were comfy and light, but could see everything. The straps and lace were also flimsy. I‚Äôm looking for my wedding morning but it wouldn‚Äôt be good for long term.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love it! Im a sz 2 126lbs 34DDD ordered a Medium and it fit perfectly! Not too loose not too tight

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Little snug

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This silk set is so soft and very comfortable!! I was impressed with the color once I recieved it, I ordered the lilac color and it's so nice! The only negative is that I'd only handwash this set as I'm not sure it would hold up in the washer machine!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was very pleased when these Pj's arrived. They are very nice quality. The lace and silk and finish are beautiful, I would definitely buy this again!

  I have been a Prime member for years.  And, I have always done my research by reading tons of reviews before buying an item but I‚Äôve never left a review... until now.  This bra is awesome!  I had to write a review about it right away and shout it from the rooftop.  If you are like me and love your Victoria Secret bras but are tired of paying their steep price, you might want to try this bra.  No lie, it‚Äôs amazing!  When I first opened the package, it looked like my Victoria Secret‚Äôs Body By Victoria Lined Demi-Buste bra. So much so that, I pulled my Vicky bra out of my dresser and did a comparison. I was right, everything is  the same with the exception of the straps, cup slightly taller, and 3 hooks verses 2.  The Vicky‚Äôs bra has lace trim sewn into the bra strap from the top of the strap down onto the cup. The Maidenform has soft elastic straps. To be honest, I did think they were going to dig into my shoulders but they haven‚Äôt. The straps are actually very soft and stretchy and a lot more comfortable than my Vicky‚Äôs bra. The Maidenform cup is slightly taller by 1/4 inch in the cup. And, the back strap is slightly wider and has 3 hooks instead of 2.  And, the Maidenform seems to lift my girls up better than Vicky‚Äôs. And, it seems to hold in my side and back fat better too.  I was going to take a picture of myself in this bra.  But then I throught, every woman is shaped differently and holds their weight differently.  So, I‚Äôll do one better and give you specifics. I‚Äôll do a comparison of the Maidenform Comfort Devotion Embellished Bra and the Victoria Secert‚Äôs Body By Victoria Lined Demi-Buste; both a size 36D.  That way, you can make your own informed decision as to whether or not this bra is right for you. Me personally, I LOVE how the Maidenform‚Äôs Comfort Devotion bra fits and feels!  I will definitely buy more. Oh and just in case you were wondering... I carry my weight on my midsection, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 175lbs, and wear a 36D in bras and a Large in clothes. I‚Äôm a very happy customer to have found this bra. I‚Äôve been searching for what seems like forever. Not only does the bra fit well but it‚Äôs comfortable and didn‚Äôt cost me a fortune. 100% A+ Pictures attached for comparison.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I have a really hard time trying to find bras that fit because my breasts are full on the bottom, a bit far apart, and I have a fair amount of ""underarm boob,"" whatever you wanna call it. My bras tend to either have significant gapping at the top or cut sharply into my underarm. There has never been a bra that fit me as well as this one. It supports everything and tucks in my underarm fat without being too loose for the tops of my breasts. It's super soft and comfy and gives a great, natural silhouette, too, and it's *just* thick enough to conceal your nipples quite well. Comfort-wise, I can barely feel I'm wearing it, even when I'm wearing it at home or during long, gruelling workdays as a waitress. My only complaint is I could do without the lace detail, as it gets kind of ratty and it can be seen under some shirts. Doesn't really need to be there, but eh, I'm nitpicking. This is the perfect everyday bra, especially if you have weird boobs like me!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  For awhile, these bras had some kind of defect where a part of the strap near the stitching was extremely scratchy and sharp. I had ordered quite q few in different colors and they all came that way.But now, they are back to being awesome again and no longer have that scratchy area.These are the most comfortable bras ever. Highly recommend again.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Ladies listen up. This. Bra. Is. The. Best. Bra. I. Have. Ever. Worn. I'm so serious! Best purchase ever! Heres why:1. Its so comfortable. Its DEVINE. Super soft material on both the outside and inside.2. Its so attractive! The lace detail is a nice sexy touch but doesnt take away at all from the comfort.3. Just the right amount of lift. Not a push up bra, not thin as paper like a bralette either. Just perfect.4. Amazing fit! All my other bras from VS, aerie or target are getting old even though I havent had them that long. My weight has fluctuated a lot and my other bras dont fit anymore and are stretched out. Under my bust area is 32 inches and my bust is 36 inches. I got the 34 C if that helps anyone! No spillage or gaping and I have it on the loosest hook!Im so happy I found this gem. Overall wonderful bra and I plan on buying more colors.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is the bra I wear almost daily and I have several of them. I usually buy them from a Dept. store so when I saw them in Amazon I thought it was a really great price. There were several reviews that stated the underwire came out or moved or rubbed against their breast and caused pain. However, I thought I‚Äôd try and see if these were as good as the ones I bought in the store, but turns out these are inferior. After just a few days I started having pain under my armpit just where the underwire of my bra hit. I‚Äôm getting to the point where I have to stop and think of what I‚Äôm buying on Amazon because so many products are fake. I would say this would be one of them. I‚Äôm so disappointed.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Finally! This is the perfect bra for me. For years I got my bras from Victoria's Secret. Some time ago they discontinued all the ones that fit me . Since then I've been frustrated. Even hired a bra consultant. Her choices were the worst - uncomfortable, gaping. I have small breasts and use bra inserts and the  inserts actually fell out of the ones she brought! Then I found this bra here on Amazon. I've ordered 3 now and can't believe my luck. They are so comfortable, attractive, allow full coverage, no gaps and really give me a great shape, far better than those I used to get at Victoria's Secret. I actually appear full-busted. Friends thought I'd had breast augmentation! I love them and would buy 3 more  if they came in gray, taupe and navy blue..

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is my favoured bra brand.  They are  good quality  and great design. Excelent support  for D sizes.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is just the best bra I've got at least 5 of these... unbelievably silky, comfortable and high quality I want it in every colour.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The manufacturers packaging was poor, causing the product to arrive creased.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Nice bra, fits like a second skin, very soft.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Perfect fit and comfort,first choice always.

  I am 5'6"" tall and weigh 138lbs. and purchased the size small. I have a very small chest - 34AA or 34A cup. So I am usually looking for lingerie without cups or actual bras, as I inevitable cannot fill them out.  This does not have a bra - so no cups, underwire or support.  For a smaller sized breast, this top is amazing. I love how it looks - it is pretty see-through and nipples are not hidden, but it has a nice plunge so it gives the illusion of cleavage.  If you have a very large bosom, I am not sure this piece will support you well, and you might fall out of it, but for smaller gals - yes, it totally works!For the price, this is a cute piece of lingerie.  It is not super high-end, but it fit well, was not scratchy and looks cute paired with these garter stockings: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012QMTAK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1I washed it in the machine without a bag - and it was fine, I would not suggest that though, and have since ordered a washing bag for it.  I line dried it.I am older, so not a toned young thing anymore - I like lingerie that will cover my tummy and hips. They are not huge by any means, but they aren't as tight as when I was 25, so I like to hide them slightly.  This baby-doll is very feminine and with the split up the front, it is very flattering.  It is flowy, so it shows enough, without squeezing you anywhere.I have no idea how long it will hold up, but for 14 - 15 dollars, I can't complain and expect that it will last at least long enough to get my money's worth out of it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5ft 2in. 150lbs. 36D. 40in hips.I normally wear between a medium and large.The size chart placed me in a size large.I ordered the large. It fits perfectly. This hides my mama belly with a little bit of peekaboo, and enough flowy fabric to make me feel ethereal and sexy.The fabric isn't scratchy. A little handwash in lingerie detergent and fabric softener made it comfortably soft to lounge in bed and read in.I would recommend this item.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Men, spend the sixteen bucks and get one for your Lovergirl.  This one is very sheer, and leaves very little to the imagination.  Your gal will look great in it and feel sexy as well.I also bought the Avidlove Women Lingerie Lace Babydol V Neck Sleepwear Strap Chemise, in black, for less than fifteen bucks.  This one is not sheer, and leaves a little to the imagination.  Be careful not to order the cross-strap, unless its preferred.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Wore this for my wedding night! It was beautiful and comfortable. Fits just right and he loved it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great fit, quality and price, if you are on the fence, get off! The fit was perfect for me, Im 5'4"" and 140 lbs very firm. I bought a medium and it fit perfect. If you have larger breasts you may want a L but my chest is on the small side so it fit well!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought the green one and it is absolutely beautiful! My husband loves it. The material is soft and not scratchy. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù 150 lbs and the medium fit great. Will order again in more colors.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I got this for my mother for her honeymoon, and she loved it (although she was a bit scandalized). I think my new stepfather liked it too.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love all Avidlove products.  Their lingerie are sexy and flattering for all body types. I'm short and a little chubby but this open front piece looks so good and sexy on me. It's comfortable too and the lace detail is not itchy at all. Durable as well, as I have washed it in with the washing machine and it didnt come out frayed or damaged. 5 stars!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Unfortunately when I ordered this the first time it was stopped by customs but I was very quickly informed and refunded. So, I tried again and it came faster than expected. It fits me exactly as I wanted and seems great. For the price this is amazing.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Good

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It's a cute concept, but the actual product is a little different than how it looks online.The lace isn't as fine as it looks, and the garment itself is quite a lot shorter, it hit me just barely below my bum.The top is also not ideal for us small chested ladies either, the cups are a little too far spread to keep the nips contained.Cute but not for me.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5'5"", 115lb, 34A. I took the small size and it fit perfectly. It could also fit on smaller, taller, bigger person. The material is good and flexible. Its a nice piece to have ;)I washed it myself, not in the washing machine !

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The product fits like the picture shows, and makes me feel quite sexy when I wear it

  Wow , super amazing! Comfortable & sexy, was looking to spice things  up & these delivered! I normally wear a medium underwear, but I ordered a large I believe  from the charting & they fit great I‚Äôm 145 Lbs.  5‚Äô6

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I had purchased a pair quite similar to this in a large and the fit was rather tight. Went xl for this and there is quite a bit of stretch. Maybe not all are created equally?One in this batch needs stitched up on the sides, not a big deal for the price.These leave NOTHING to the imagination. So if you want something more subtle keep looking but if you are like me and NEED the feeling of wearing panties and yet not really wearing panties these are awesome.These do not scratch or irritate down there. Bits feel pretty free range so maybe not the best to wear with jeans and jean shorts (don't want pinching) but anything you feel you can go pantyless in these will work well.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  If you manage to figure out your right size than these are cute and comfortable. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 140lbs. I wear a size US4 in pants and usually a Small for undies. I read the reviews and their size chart and thought ordering a L would work. The bad news is they sent me an XL, the good news is that the XL actually fit, the L would have been too small. So all that to say, if you‚Äôre regularly a small get and XL (ridiculous, I know).

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  They make me horny. They fit, perhaps a touch too small but they fit. Do it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  After seeing that these fit snugly and was recommended to buy a bigger size .... I‚Äôm glad I went with an XL. I‚Äôm normally a US med panttie. I‚Äôm so happy with the fit and style.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  They were very nice and I would have kept but way too small - I wear a small but bought a medium - they were at least 2 sizes too small.  Seller did refund my purchase so good seller!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Cheap fabric to small though the chart said it was the right size. Overall not happy about this.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not very comfortable material.. runs a little small

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, 190 lbs and a size 36F. I was surprised at how well the bra fit despite most lingerie I buy being waaaaaay too small in the bust. Bought this for a boudoir shoot and it covers me in all the right places! Def  worth the purchase. I would size up so that you don‚Äôt have pinching and rolling - I bought a 2XL despite wearing an XL I regular clothes.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was skeptical about sizing due to the other reviews. I am 5‚Äô4, 160 and purchased a large. I could‚Äôve definitely used a medium and still been fine.This is super sexy... ladies you will set the tone with this one!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I NEVER leave reviews, EVER. But I just had too because maybe someone is like me and needs to hear this. I am 8 month pp with my first child and self love has been a struggle. Constantly feeling gross and just uncomfortable with my body and find it hard to put anything on let alone lingerie and feel good. I‚Äôve been wanting to do something nice for my man and to just show him a little bit of effort to make things fun for us because we haven‚Äôt gotten any time alone since the baby. I literally thought about canceling my order a million times because I just knew I was gonna hate the way it fit me because I‚Äôm not skinny like the ad pictured BUT BOY WAS I WRONG. I wear a size 10/12 in jeans, I weigh about 170, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4, I wear a 36DDD and putting this on literally brought me to tears because I just felt so good. It completely made my Fupa and side/back rolls disappear and I just felt sexy and instantly excited to get ready and show all this off to my man! I got the xxl because of the reviews I read and I‚Äôm not disappointed one bit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Purchased for plus size girlfriend. The 2x fit her fantastic. Eye candy for me. She has 18-20 pant size, 18-20 dress size, 46b bra size. Maybe that will help someone else out. Avidlove lingerie I'd the best a cheapest for the awesome quality.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I got an XL, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 180 lbs. C cup chest, big butt, fit great. Stays on. Probably could have gotten away with a large but it adjusts everywhere.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered two colors in xxxl. My VERY first thoughts upon opening were ‚Äúwow these colors are beautiful!‚Äù And ‚Äúoh my goodness they are soo soft‚Äù I love the size of the bottoms, I was actually most nervous about those not fitting. The quality is more than fantastic for the price point, this is a wonderful buy ladies. My only complain that the cut for the front lace of the thong is incredibly small for being a xxxl therefore I switched the underwear for the pictures.I am 5 foot 6 Inches, I typically wear a 38c, 36 waist, 44 hips.A size 00 shirt at torrid and size 16 jeans typically.I can wear size large Addidas tops And medium adidas joggers but had to order a xxxl.But I‚Äôm awkwardly shaped.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This was the second color purchased for my girlfriend. It is hard to find clothing that fits her, but no problems with this. Looks great (but she'd make anything look great).

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is a pretty sexy set! Quality is a little iffy but it‚Äôs not bad. (It reminds me of the kind of quality you get with some online costumes.) I had some troubles with the undies. The strings twirl on themselves so it takes patience to straighten them back out. The bra allows for spillage which I guess is a good thing if you have nice boobs- mine are a bit ehh after having a baby so I would have appreciated a bit more support. Overall I think it‚Äôs worth a try! Especially if you‚Äôre just wanting to dabble in lingerie and don‚Äôt want to spend a lot of money.

  I have bought numerous bralettes and had to return because they don't fit, but these are AMAZING! AND AMAZING QUALITY! I am a 34E and weigh 143 pounds and I bought a large and I am so happy!!! Will definitely buy more! If you have big boobs this is the bralette for you!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I usually wear a 36 B and my ribcage measures 33"". Usually, I wear a medium in US sized tops and bralettes.I first tried these bras in medium and got stuck. I could not even get it on all the way. Back it went. They are really pretty though, so I ordered 2 more in the next 2 sizes up, L and XL. I got the Large on, though it was a little bit difficult to squeeze through it. Pretty good fit once on, but a struggle to get it back off. The XL worked out great. Easy enough to get on and off, and it fits perfect. I was worried the XL would be better suited for someone well endowed, but it's perfect for my plums!Great tee-shirt bra too, no extra back rolls/bulges. Just runs really, REALLY small. Could really use a re-labeling of their sizes imo.My 2 pack of bras in black and buff are identical in size and same lace.It was hard to find the right size, but really happy with them in the end.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Alright y‚Äôall..These are amazing! I am a 36G, 5‚Äô8‚Äô‚Äô 180lbs and haven‚Äôt found a bralette that fits. My previous ones leave me with nip slips and small cup sizes. However, with these, I feel very secure. The band is perfect, the cups are perfect, and they‚Äôre lightly padded. I recommend everyone buys these. I ordered a large.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  As someone with big boobs, I‚Äôm always leery of bralettes, even when the reviews are good. As far as fit goes, this product is the holy grail of bralettes. It looks pretty and flattering, and the XXL holds in my 38DD chest with ZERO nip slip OR digging in. It actually holds me in well enough that I can comfortably wear it to run errands or go for a walk. It also doesn‚Äôt feel constricting or create back fat, even when I‚Äôm wearing it with a fitted tank top!  For fit and function alone, I would have given this 5 stars.Unfortunately, I have only had these bras for only two months and they are already falling apart. As you can see in the picture, the lace is tearing up at the top in between my two boobs. I would have thought that maybe it just got caught on something and torn without me noticing, but the same holes are happening in the same place on BOTH bras that came in the pack. Since they fit so well and comfortably, I think this is some kind of flaw and not a problem of my bra being the wrong size.  I think too months is too soon for my bra to be falling apart like that, so that is why I took away two stars.All in all, it‚Äôs a comfortable and flattering bra that looks super cute even if you‚Äôre not tiny, but unless I just got a bad batch, the durability is lacking.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered these bralettes hoping they would fit, be comfortable, I was happy they are so pretty, and it‚Äôs not just a choice of white or buff (it‚Äôs hard to find fun colors in larger sizes).I am absolutely in LOVE with these especially because I despise most all bras, honestly I generally didn‚Äôt wear one for a long time until I found these!! The lace is gorgeous and very comfortable with the perfect amount of stretch for me. I have a chronic stomach illness and having something pressing on the top of my stomach is a no go for me (haven‚Äôt found a regular wireless bra/bralette that doesn‚Äôt do this and support my breast at the same time), these happen to be the perfect solution for me.For reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù, 36DD/38DD, and 170lbs. I ordered the 2X (I didn‚Äôt want to be spilling over the top of the bralette or worry about a nip slip) and they fit me perfectly. I don‚Äôt like feeling restricted by a bra and these don‚Äôt give me that feeling, but they do support me well. They are not too tight, but I did have to take the pads out to get a little extra room (I‚Äôm ok with that). I have no problem taking it off or putting it on, I have seen multiple reviews that people needed help getting them off, not an issue for me. I will be ordering more of these because they have now become my favorite bra/bralette. The lace is soft and comfortable to me and the elastic is perfect. I have even fallen asleep with one on and was incredibly comfortable. I launder mine on delicate and in a lingerie bag and hang dry, I‚Äôve had no problems with wear and tear even though the instructions are to hand wash. If you‚Äôre on the fence, go for it, you won‚Äôt be sorry.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was skeptical about buying this type of bra online because any time I‚Äôve tried one on in a store they have never come close to doing me any justice. I‚Äôm a 36D in a regular bra and I these miraculous skin sacks are the biproducts of nursing three children. It takes one heck of a bra to impress me. So, do they put the girls up in my throat where i wish they were? Well no. But, for not having an underwire, I have to admit that I was pretty darn impressed with the shape and support they provided. Not as much lift as a regular bra would provide but at least it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt give me a uniboob like a sports bra does. Totally worth price. Try them out. You won‚Äôt be sorry.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought this to go under a backless shirt and it worked perfectly. It's comfortable, it's supportive, its beautiful. I've started wearing it under my normal clothes because it's SO comfy! I'm 5'6, 40DD and I got an XXL.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The detail and lace and padding are great along with the overall shape which is flattering.  I usually wear a small and ordered a medium and it's still pretty snug.  A large would probably fit more comfortably. I would order at least one size up and maybe two then return the one that doesn't fit.  Otherwise, a really nice bralette that has some support.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Los mejores bralettes!! Se ven muy bonitos y femeninos puestos, acomodan incre√≠ble, el encaje es s√∫per suavecito y no pica ni incomoda, y lo mejor es que dan un s√∫per soporte (mejor incluso que varios brassiers de varilla).  S√∫per apto para mujeres con busto grande. Tiene copas. La talla corresponde. No pidan ni m√°s abajo ni m√°s arriba. Creo que no volver√© a usar brassier convencional despu√©s de tener estos. Recomendados al 100%. Si esta rese√±a te fue √∫til da click en me gusta para evaluar si escribir otras rese√±as

  Reference: I‚Äôm a size 34 full DD size X-LargeNever been able to wear these cute little bras b/c boobs will always spill out. This bralette is  very comfortable, fits really nice and is super sexy. But most importantly it holds the girls in. So it‚Äôs a winner!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The quality's good and it looks GREAT - this is a sexy little bra and looks awesome peeking under a cardigan or with an off-shoulder top. The band is not elastic, though - it has no stretch or give to it - so if you are wider than the band it digs in and can be pretty uncomfortable. I ordered an XL and I would say it's a 34 to 36 band size and a B cup. Based on that and the other item I ordered from this seller, here's what I would guesstimate this fits like. Hope this is useful and really, if you're on the smaller side, go for it, you get two great bras that are casually sexy, which is so rare!XL - 34B-36B if you are on the smaller sideL - 34B -32BM - 32B-30BS- 28-32 A or small BI wish they'd make these in one more size up - as a 38B it'd be perfect!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The grey bra fits fine, but the black one doesn't. The black one is the same size, and the exact same model size as another I had bought as a single, but it is significantly smaller and very uncomfortable. For reference, I wear a 38G (UK sizing). The grey one is lovely. I just wish the black one fit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Je ne commente pas souvent mes achats mais cette bralette est parfaite! Je porte du 38D et j‚Äôai command√© la XL. Elle tient bien en place et le tissu semble ferme. Je pensais l‚Äôutiliser seulement √† la maison mais apr√®s essayage, je serais ¬´¬†game¬†¬ª d‚Äôaller travailler avec elle! De plus, elle est vraiment belle. Mon mari confirme mes dires!

  Let me tell you! I ordered this piece on a whim.  It has been so long since I have made an effort for love making routines.  Just usually shower and put on whatever night clothes I can find (because we know it's coming off anyway).  But, this has changed the game.  My hubby was excited and obviously felt special when he saw me in this.  For me, I felt sexy as h***.  As a woman with a love pouch and stretch marks galore, I felt confident.  I'm 5'6, 145 lbs, with a small frame and cup size (A,B) I ordered a medium.  It fit great.  Do yourselves a favor and order it.  I've learned that something so simple makes our partners feel like royalty.  And, yes, it was definitely, worth the purchase ;)! I will definitely be ordering more items from this line!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Definitely one of the finer lingerie pieces I've owned!The top is chiffon and see through and cascades across your upper body. The material is silky smooth and lightweight.The bottom's lace is absolutely gorgeous and soft.The tie up back is my favorite part!I love it, such a unique piece.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Can fit a lot of gals different shapes

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered this sexy piece of lingerie for an adult party. I  am 5'6 and 155 pounds, I ordered a large. It's a little tight around the bottom, but it's pretty true to size. It's by no means a high quality piece, but for the cost it seems pretty decent. I would definitely order from this company again. Shipping was quick.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits great and for the price very pretty. Would totally recommend to someone else. My boyfriend likes the way it fits my bigger sized body. (2x-3x in shirt & 16 in waist.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered this product twice. The first time in a peacock blue and it looked A-MAy-ZinG on me. As I've been keeping an eye out for a good white color lingerie to buy I figured that this one was a safe bet. It was not.The peacock blue made me look lithe, tall and alluring. I suppose it just really complimented my coloring. The white made me look tall, but frumpy around the middle. The white color made the transition from the chiffon top to the lace bottoms super obvious and to me it looked awkward and as though I had a muffin top.Overall I think this is a piece that would work well for most body types, the top is a halter that drapes quite nicely assuming you purchase the correct size. And the lace bottom is soft enough to wear around the house for a few hours. As long as you're not hoping for something to give the girls a lift, I think this is a solid purchase.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I really liked this. Will be ordering in another color.I'm 5'7 and 219 lbs and the xxl actually fit once I adjusted the back.It's adjustable and sexy. I just really really like it. Makes your top and bottom look really appealing!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  There is nothing wrong with this one piece lingerie. Fits right in all the right places. Valentine's is just around the corner and your better half will absolutely appreciate that Amazon box being delivered this time. For me I didn't think I would've liked an lingerie like this but I was wrong. I'm 5'7 tall and weight about 240 and I ordered a 2xl. Maybe this will help better I wear 38C in bra and a size 18 in pants.

  I was initially intimidated to wear something that feels dominate and over my whole body ,however I couldn't have felt Sexier. I can't believe how well it fit my 170 pound mom body and I'm 5'7. It works great for rope play provided a lil protection.  I had buy second one for cheap thrills if you know what I mean. The price makes it worth it!

  I love cosabella panties- way more than hanky panky or cheaper imitation ones on amazon that will only really last a year. I have a pair of cosabella that looks in great shape still after 3 years. Spend the extra cash and get good panties! They are so comfortable, made of quality materials and will actually last. I wish there were more color options on amazon though.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôve been a hanky panky fan for years. Well, until I discovered cosabella. The quality is better, the design more flattering and the material is sturdier.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am a long time wearer of this practical and stylish product. Fits well, and shows no oanty line. This is my every day style. I enjoy collecting c many colors. When I have no matching bra I coordinate with blush bra in same place from CosabellaPlease keep offering more colors in combination packs.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I've been a Hanky Panky thong devotee for many years but noticed the last time I bought them the quality wasn't as good. (I owned my first batch for literally YEARS before they had to be replaced.) I tried these Cosabella thongs for the first time and LOVE them. Great quality, very comfortable, and nice colors.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This panties are beautiful and well made as described, but I don't think this would fit all (or even close to all).  I am 5'7"" and maybe 130lbs and they could be bigger on me. I won't put them in the dryer. The only reason I am not giving a 5 is because of the one size fits all. I would give them a 4.5 if it was an option.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The lace is soft with just the right amount of stretch. The cut is more midrise and not too rigid, so it hugs my curves just the way I want it to. Pricey, but 100% worth it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very comfortable and still looks good

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love Cosabella panties! They fit really well and are very comfortable.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Don't buy these! If you know Cosabella underwear, you will see these are not authentic. I have the exact style and size from another supplier and they are completely different! The quality, fit and details are way under par compared to the authentic ones. Amazon, please pull this supplier. I am not returning since of course I have tried them. (They are underwear, of course) but I would if I could!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I absolutely LOVE Cosabella thongs. I never used to wear thongs then a friend showed me these one and from the feel of the material to the fit was perfect..

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fit great

  I am a size XL, 5‚Äô5‚Äù 180lbs if that helps. i also used their given size chart and measured myself. Wore this out on the town and got so many compliments. Was a little short and just needed to be careful my booty didn‚Äôt show but that‚Äôs with any mini length dress. Overall I love this dress and have recommended it to friends already

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Material feels a bit cheap and holds its shape instead of being as clingy as I would like, the lace racerback is stiff, but it still looks sexy on so... I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù ~140 lbs and between a B to C cup. I got a small and this was definitely the right size for me. The opaque part ends just right at the bottom of my butt so it covers but can easily slip up which I find cute/sexy

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  First impressions are great! We shall see how it lasts over time.The size chart link is worthless. Use the size chart image down in the product description.Helpfully this is helpful to others. My wife is 5ft 6in 150 lbs and fits a Large.Her measurements:Bust: 40""Under Bust: 35""Waist: 35.5""Hips: 38""

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love how flattering and comfortable this dress is!! It is cut in the perfect shape and is so comfy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very cute satin slip . I only wear Victoria secret nighties (m) and this compares as far as the satin. Obviously VS‚Äôs lace is nicer quality and not stretchy . But I don‚Äôt mind that . This runs small I ordered the large and it fits perfectly. Not too tight but not as loose as in the picture. Definitely would recommend this  and I like the huge color selection plus quick shipping. I hand washed this because I didn‚Äôt know if the color would bleed as some other reviewers said. Mine is in the dark blue and didn‚Äôt bleed.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Decent quality. I wear a size 12, the XXL was a little too big. The XL would have been perfect.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is so fitting. It is adjustable if needed. I purchased an XL for a roomy top but I'm sure a large would've fit. I love the lacey parts. Very sexy.Body comp: 174lbs, 38M ta-tas, usually a large/12-14 in most tops.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The fabric  light and soft. I love how it fits in the chest area. My breast‚Äôs are comfortable. It gets tight around the waste and only covers half my butt unless pulled down. I‚Äôm 5‚Äù3 and 233 lbs. I usually fit between a 0 and a 1 at Torrid. My jean size is 14 at torrid. Size 14-16 elsewhere. My torso is narrow but my stomach hangs post pregnancy and weight gain. If it was a bit longer and a tad wider on the butt area it would be perfect.  It‚Äôs still wearable but I don‚Äôt feel confident in it. I‚Äôm planing to keep and keep as a motivation for weight loss.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I usually like all this seller/brand chemises & pjs but not this. Looks a little tacky especially with side lace detail. The lace trim is also too large again looking somewhat tacky. I bought it for the chemise & threw out the g string as I don't understand how girls can wear them LOL. I much prefer their other style chemises of which I have many. Lucky I didn't buy more of these. The sizing is smaller than their other chemises so size up. I bought a larger size as I like them flowy & it fits but fitted fit not loose & flowing. Wouldn't buy again as it really looks like those tacky pieces on wish.com type garments.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not a good fit. I have an hourglass shape. It wasn't fitted to my bra line and had a straight side seam down to the hem. The hips were tighter but the back was so loose. It made me look boxy and it was extremely unflattering and didn't fit and I ordered the smallest size I could

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I like the cut but the material isn‚Äôt super soft as I expected. It‚Äôs thicker

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Looks nicer in pic

Hanes Womens Cotton Bikini Underwear Multi-packs (Colors May Vary),4.3,19775,False,https://www.amazon.com//Hanes-Womens-Cotton-Bikini-Assorted/dp/B000J3AWUQ/ref=sr_1_115?crid=2HKWU10901ND2&keywords=sexy+lingerie&qid=1649384843&sprefix=sexy+lingerie&sr=8-115,Visit the Hanes Store, $9.47$9.47 - $32.50$32.50 ,"

  So I purchased these THEN read the reviews and freaked out. Tried to cancel but it was too late. I received 10 medium sized underwear that looked huge but shrank during washing so they fit perfect. I received 100% cotton so I don‚Äôt know what the heck other people where getting. The material was consistent with other games products I have bought and I‚Äôm not sure how luxurious a box of 10 panties for $15 are supposed to be. Apparently they should feel like Egyptian cotton according to these ratings. They were a little stiff but washing with fragrance free laundry softener soften them fine. The band could have been made better but they stayed together fine after washing and again, THEY WERE ONLY $15. These are period panties at best and yeast control at worse. If you‚Äôre looking for luxury then fork out the extra bucks. Otherwise, I‚Äôm pretty happy with what I expected from a $15 box of cotton underwear.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I have worn Hanes Bikini Style Size 7 (which Hanes is calling a large) for many, many years so I felt confident buying these underwear online. I bought these, washed them and put them in the dryer and now they are so small they barely cover my  barely-there Asian butt. I'm 5'4"" 140 lbs with a small hips, small butt. I'm not sure I believe that these were manufactured by Hanes but perhaps Amazon has contracted them from Hanes and they were made in China. The quality is cheap -  they started out somewhat small for a Size 7 and now there are more like a very small size 6. Now I just have 10 pairs of underwear that I can't wear. Not sure what to think...

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I've been wearing this brand, size (6) and style for many years and been very happy. It's been several years since  purchasing and as with many manufacturers, they've cut the quality of the product by using poor quality materials and less of them. The elastic band has been reduced to nearly half the width it used to be and the panty itself has been ""scaled down"" using much, much less fabric than previously purchased product. Also, the quality of the fabric is way thinner and somewhat stiff, especially in the patterned pairs. Yes, the price is low, but I would NOT buy these again even at the cheap price.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  There was a difference of over 2 inches in the waistband size from one pair to the next. They were all labeled the same size but as you can see I. The picture they are not the same size.They are all mass produced on a machine, there should not be this much difference in one pack of underwear. Have bought this brand for years at the store with no issues. Who would think there was this much of a difference ordering on line. Maybe it‚Äôs to cover my yo-yo dieting giving me multiple waist band widths in one pack to cover all my size changes throughout the yearüòÇ. Not keeping them, didn‚Äôt even bother trying them on since they larger ones would have just fallen off.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I have bought the same type and style from Hanes since...well let's not go there (Ok at least 20+ years). The underwear used to last A LOT longer. Now it's getting holes or the stitching is coming out on a brand new pair and some only last one wearing. The fabric is MUCH thinner then it used to be and it's been seeming like each time I get a new pack it gets thinner. I've noticed other comments about the same thing so it's not like we are imagining it. I hate to sound like the old fart saying ""back in my day my underwears lasted WAY longer."" But yeah. I'm saying it now. It took a real bad day or unexpected friend coming to visit to kill those darn undies. But, alas these undies just aren't the same as they used to be. I used to only buy Hanes because it was Fruit of a Loom that would fall apart and have the thinner fabrics. Nope. Both about the same now. Looking for a time machine to go back to 1999 and buy the old Hanes biki style. They fit as expected and the wedgie factor has been worked out (think around the 2000's they changed the fit a bit). While the fit has improved the fabric quality has gone down hill. Still a good basic bikini pair of undies that won't give you a wedgie.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Be warned - they sell several products that are similar but not the same. A month ago I received what I expected. This time the ones I received were not 100% cotton. They are 75% cotton and 25% something else.  The elastic on the more recent set are also thinner and not as durable. The fabric feels less soft.  I'm very disappointed these are not as described.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Edit: the seams were too harsh for me personally so I returned them!If you're looking for 100% cotton to try to help your pH these seem to be overall a good deal. The heather pairs have 25% polyester however, but there was only 1 polyester pair in all 10 of the pairs I received. That being said, the leopard print pair feels so stiff with dye that's on the surface that I'm not sure if that will breathe well either as it's a surface print instead of a fabric dye. Holding in moisture is definitely not good for you! All in all, I might throw out 2 pairs, but at this price, these are still worth it for 100% cotton underwear. I really wanted to switch to only natural fiber underwear to try to help my flora. I've read polyester can hold moisture so I'm hoping this change will help me out!For comfort I can't speak to it yet because I just received them so they need to go through the wash before I wear them, but the fabric feels nice and soft, and even the inside of the waistband seems to be made purposefully soft. They moved the seams that are typically found on the outside of the hips to slightly in front, which makes it so when you lay on your side the seams don't dig into your hips. This is also a nice change.Hope this review helps someone else who's looking for cotton, polyester free underwear!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought these for once a month panties, so they are ok. Not real soft, but not bad either. Elastic in the waist & legs, which I like. Happy with the coverage- doesn't cover your whole bottom & go halfway up your back- nice cut & low/med rise. I got pretty colors. I'm 219lbs & size 9 fits perfectly.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These look to be good quality knickers. For info, all the Hanes knickers are these sizes - size 6 is uk 8-10, size 7 is 12-14, size 8 is 14-16, size 9 is 16-18 and size 10 is 18-20. I hope this helps someone as i ordered the wrong size!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The pack of blue illustrates patterned Hanes Bikini underwear.  But not patterned items in the package.  The fabric has less substance.  I bought these from UK hoping for previous Hanes good quality and was disappointed will not buy again as their product is no longer at its previous high standard

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Feels like duplicate Hanes! They are quite comfortable... But they are not as soft as expected, quality isn't very good.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The size options are stated to be L, M, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12I ordered M, as I know that‚Äôs my size.  What arrived was a size 5 - which as the size chart on the pack rightly states is S for small.

  Came exactly as pictured! Very sexy little outfit and it even comes with fake glasses. I just ordered my regular size of what I normally wear and it fit me fine! I'm 5'2 and about 250lbs for reference. I defintely feel for women who weigh less than me it would still fit bc the material almost shapes to your body. Cant wait to wear this and make my mans night!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My husband was so turned on when I took pics of me in this. I have pics but I can't put those type of pics up here due to them being too enticing. I am 6'0 at about 220 and it worked for me. All I will say is WOW. This outfit does not disappoint. If you need something to help your spouse pull an all-nighter, this is it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It's actually pretty comfortable and my husband loves it. The shade of blue used is so pretty. I already wear glasses so the prop glasses kind of disappeared. I literally have no idea where they went. I paired this with some sexy crotchless tights. The size fits well and it's stretchy so it continued to fit while I grew from pregnancy, which may or may not have had to do with the outfit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very comfortable, very flattering, this little outfit had exactly the intended effect on my boyfriend that I'd hoped. He loved it, I loved it, and it'll get more use for sure. The little glasses were cute too, even though I already wear glasses, I put these on instead and just used a cute pair of Mary Jane heels I already had. The slit in the skirt it very flattering as well. It is a bit on the short side, so if you're taller or have a longer torso it'll cover less. Also, I have a larger chest, and the part that fastens around the neck is just held up by a small bit of velcro, so it may not stay closed very long. If you're questioning whether or not to get this though, I'd say it's worth it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Arrived early. The outfit looked very small, but the fabric stretches enough to cover where it must - barely, and not for long. It rides up immediately with any movement. The skirt must be tugged down constantly. Like many Chinese garments, when the horizontal size increases, the vertical size does not, so it's wide enough, but not high enough. If you couldn't tell from the photo, the top is quite sheer, clearly intended for the bedroom, not for wearing in public. The skirt's vents on each side are placed just right to show the satin bows at the tops of my long white stockings (similar to B0142PPWQU but without the ruffles, just the bow).  The glassless ""glasses"" are a nice touch. Overall the outfit is cute but not quite as attractive in person as it looked on the website, and a bit pricy considering what you get for the money, especially considering the constant need to fight the way it rides up all the time. If I had it to do over again, knowing what I know now, I would not buy it again. However, it is cute and goes well with my stockings and Mary Jane shoes.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Arrived on time!! Love this to cute... The material is a bit on the thin side but I have no plans on wearing it outside... It's definitely more of a costume vs lingerie.... But my boyfriend will love it it's his fantasy!!! I'm a size 18 bra size DDD but the skirt is kinda short  in the back so if u have a really big butt it might hang out a lil more then u like but it's for sexy time so maybe not such a big problem üòèüòú

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm a plus size gal and finding sexy lingere that I want to wear AND makes me feel cute/sexy is challenging, but this  nailed it. It's form fitting in the right places (breasts) and falls just right so the belly/hips are covered with the plaid skirt. I didn't use the glasses, they are kind of ugly and have no lenses.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Girlllllllll, it‚Äôs cute! I love it. I feel so hot in it. For reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù - 165 pounds and it fits great. It‚Äôs a little lose in the tummy area so that‚Äôs perfect for me and I can imagine this fitting girls bigger than me as well. I had to edit out the girly parts in my pics and my face cause I was looking crusty but I am so excited to wear this for my man. I know he‚Äôs going to love it. The top is very sheer so you definitely see nipples through it. And the skirt is perfectly short enough. It is so sexy and I think probably my favorite lingerie piece I‚Äôve ever had.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  this fitted fine

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love this!  It‚Äôs very flattering and sexy.  I surprised my husband with it and his jaw dropped.  I felt super confident in it too, because I knew I looked good. üòâ My hubby keeps saying it‚Äôs his favourite.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I really like this. Super easy and cute. Felt confident in it and let's say it didn't stay on long when my husband saw it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love this! Feels Nice! It‚Äôs stretchy and the top is see through!

  Boyfriend loves them. I also ordered the red lace ones, but they were not made well. The crosses in the back were not centered. I ordered a small. I am 5'5"" 118 pounds.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  First off, male user here. I have purchased all the colors offered and other sofishie panties and these are by far my favorite. The fit is perfect, I ordered medium and I have a 32‚Äù waist. I love the quality, how they feel and how they make my ass look. Totally recommend.

  Love these! As a 51 year young woman,  I love finding sexy, comfortable panties that make me love being a woman! Have added other colors to my wishlist!Jean size is 8  ordered a large. Great fit!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These are really cute and sexy. I wouldn‚Äôt wear them every day but as a sexy date night panty they work well. The lace is elastic-y and feels like it could rip with rough handling, but I‚Äôm not sure what else you‚Äôd expect with all over lace panties.I have a 32‚Äù waist and 45‚Äù hips. I wear 12/14 jeans and the large fits but is just a bit too tight. An XL might fit a little better, but I have a similar pair from the same brand and the XL is just on the loose side.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought two colors in the same small size. But the size is different. The red one is made of regular size and the black one is made a little larger.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Wanted to spice up my underwear drawer and decided to give these a try.My weight yo-yos and I‚Äôm currently uncomfortable with my weight and self image.I tried these on as soon as they came. Comfortable, I bought an XL and the fit was great.I didn‚Äôt tell my man about them and was curious if he would be excited or think they were weird. He loved them. Said they were sexy and couldn‚Äôt stop looking at my butt and jiggling it. It was a great night üôÉ

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These panties run some large. If you were between sizes I would highly recommend going with a smaller size. For the price of these panties, I expected  higher quality. As you can see in my photos the stitching does not line up, the lace was slightly pilled, and there was a clear hole where the liner did not get stitched to the panties at all.  Overall, I think they would be super comfy due to the delicious stretch if they fit my body a bit tighter.  These are definitely sexy, do not show panty lines, and have lovely colors.  Overall, I‚Äôm fairly pleased but the quality of the stitching leaves something to be desired.  Overall, I‚Äôd give them a 4/5 for comfort and sexiness and buy a smaller size

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I purchased a pair wanting to try them out before investing in multiple pairs.  The panties fit amazing and are super comfortable.  They are very flattering to the body and I was impressed.  Ordering additional pairs for sure.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Runs far too large and am not impressed with the quality of stitching or material.

  It runs big, when you return you lose money! It is expensive for the material! Not recommended

They are soft and fit over my giant thighs!  I thought for sure the waist would make my tummy bulge or roll down my thighs but NOPE!  They stay right where they belong!!  I am so excited to surprise my husband for his birthday!  My specs:  5 ft, 185 lbs,  42""-32""-46""

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was worried about how small they were when opening the package but they fit. I'm 5'6, 165 lbs, between size 10-12 in pants. They barely fit my thighs. Great look for something that doesn't cost much.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I LOVE THESE fishnets!!! My boyfriends love it too!!! Hehe

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These are HOT HOT HOT! To keep it in perspective, I am 5'8, 195lbs, hippy w thighs that don't exactly touch. Almost but not quite. LolI am typically very picky about my thigh highs...I hate for them to cut in or roll down. These do neither! If you have ever purchased the sexy body stockings (almost like a durable pantyhose material) they are also one size fits most & these are like those. Made the same & really ARE one size fits most.Id say these could easily fit someone as petite as 5'2 & as far up as 6' 250lbs. They are really that versatile. Hope this helps! My husband absolutely LOVES them.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5ft6in with a long torso and shorter legs & I weigh 177lbs. I was worried these would be too small but I found these to fit fantastically! They didn‚Äôt dig into maybe thighs and they sat very comfortably on my lower waist. Highly recommend!

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These are great. Im 5'6 130lbs and they fit nicely. They stretch well and could probably fit a variety of sizes.I have worn these 6 times now and they are still in perfect shape, no holes or snags. None of my other stockings last that well. Will definitely purchase again.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love to dress up sexy and I just adore these tights. They have the pattern on the front and they are solid on the black. I'm not sure if this was in the description or not but I like them a lot the way they are. These are very flattering on me and feels like a nice option to garters and stockings. Love them, but what a pain in the neck to get them just right. How many hours have you wasted in your bathroom trying to get the stockings to like up perfectly in the back? :) . I am very petite. 5'4"" 98 lbs and they fit perfectly. Although they are not baggy on me at all, a problem I have a lot with ""one size"" items), I think that these would fit women of various sizes. the fabric is soft and comfortable with a ton of stretch. I feel super sexy in these, even just by themselves ;) They also look great with a short skirt or denim shorts. I may very well come back for more for when these are in the wash!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  That was a present for a friend

||||||||||||||||||||||||

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Excellent

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super toll! Schneidet nicht ein, sitzt perfekt und Material f√ºhlt sich angenehm an. L√§sst sich sehr gut zurecht zuppeln und bleibt so wie es soll. Trage eine 36 und bin 165cm gro√ü. Ist dehnbar in alle Richtungen und sieht sehr sexy aus. Kann ich nur empfehlen...auch f√ºr etwas kr√§ftigere M√§dels geeignet.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These are much nicer than I expected. Really stretchy, but still really soft. Looks super small coming out of the package but comfortably stretches to fit. (I'm 5'6, 150lbs). I really appreciate the waistband - it definitely feels like it will stay up, but doesn't cut in, or squeeze. The toes are made of a thicker mesh too, so your toes won't make a hole easily. Great product for a great price.

  I am 5'9 200lbs with wide hips and a mommy/love gut! My jean size is 14-16 and I purchased a extra large waist cincher. It snatched your girls waist, tummy and fupa nice and tight but the thong let my booty shine and not be all smashed and not moving. Business in the front, Party in the back.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love it , waist is snatched honey I have no complaints at all period ....

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  OMG LISTEN.. THIS GIRDLE IS A GET YOUR LIFE TOGETHER RIGHT NOW MUST HAVE PIECE OF MAGIC!!! DO You hear me? Imma tell you what. It will suck u up in front and pop you out in back! I have never in my life had one perform like this one. No rolling down not uncomfortable with all your cheeks out. Nope its perfect. I want to wear it when I swim, bathe, die mmk!!!JS... I want to wear it for life! Trust me, you best get you this sucker upper. You will not regret it! I put that on my big apple bottom! ;)Thank you seller. Great product, great great price, and fast shipping. This has me running round thinking I'm to sexy for a covid mask. Well not really but you know what I'm saying.Get you this girls periodt!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I've tried so many shapewear and this is by far the best ever! I wear this one when I'm wearing tighter dresses or bodysuits and want my waist snatched. This gave me a flat stomach and hugged my curves in all the right places. It was comfortable enough to wear all night long without feeling suffocated or restricted. Seriously the best ever, I would recommend this to anyone!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These are great. they don't roll down like Spanx do which drives me mad. I didn't buy them to give me a waist so I can't comment on if they work for that. I am an hourglass figure already but wanted something to smooth my pooch when I wear dresses. Does the job wonderfully. Will be ordering more for sure!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Loved this waist shaper. I got a small. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5, 135 pounds and it sucked my stomach in. Gave my butt a great lift. It did not roll or anything. Looks great under my dress. The material I wore was thin. Great product

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great adorable tummy cincher!Light boning through the top quarter section keeps it from rolling down at all. Probably ideal for someone not carrying the majority of their weight up top (ribs and up). If so, you may want something with boning that runs deeper into the garment for better support. This is an excellent moderate compression garment.Overall A+! It‚Äôs nice and tight (think compression sock for your upper body) without being restricting like other more corset-like tops that have clasps and boning throughout. You can 100% still bend, reach, eat, and live your normal life! Not visible under any T-shirts or dresses so far.It slips up your body (with a little wiggling, but not difficult at all) and basically lays just at the edges or your bra. For someone taller (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù) it may hit a little lower, but I wouldn‚Äôt see it causing any loss of quality.It is a thong! The thong section is made of a lighter weight version of the same material as the cincher part. If you aren‚Äôt an avid wearer of thongs, this may not be an ideal purchase. I was concerned reading some of the other reviews stating that it was uncomfortable.. I didn‚Äôt think so. It‚Äôs a thong, it feels like an elastic-y thong. I actually preferred that having the thong attached prevents it from riding up your hips without having heavy boning‚Äî cause it definitely would without it!No compression wear is ideal for hot weather, but I made it through a day in the upper 80s, in full sun, without feeling faint or sweating anymore than I would have without it on.Fits true to size! I wear a size 10/12, ordered a large, fit is perfect.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Definately helps put everything in place especially since i had a baby not long ago. Slimmer waist and gave my hips a pop at the same time which I like.  I wouldnt recommend everyday use, maybe an event or so.. as for me I felt the thong area more snug but not uncomfortable. So far so good.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I sized up because I have a long torso I followed the sizing chart but still got a size up and is too short if you have a long torso get a product that says so Yianna products have this option and maybe these do too

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Thought I would try this given the reviews and the price. Bought if an effort to camouflage the dreaded mom pouch in an evening dress. I used the size guide for m/l and it‚Äôs on the large size. I would size down for these products. It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt tuck or hold anything in. Spend the money and buy spanx

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Surprisingly Comfortable!!Didn‚Äôt expect it to have a booty popping effect but that‚Äôs always a bonus.Doesn‚Äôt buckle or fold, doesn‚Äôt look obvious under your clothes, washer&dryer 3 times already and maintains the same size & the fabric is still the same. Def recommend!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I've never tried shapewear before this, but my first impression upon trying this on was a good one! It smoothed out everything it should have without looking or feeling like a super cinched corset.I haven't actually worn it out for a day/event yet so that might change my opinion of it, but it felt like it was going to stay up and not roll down.Definitely read the sizing chart before purchasing. I am generally a large, but the sizing chart told me to buy the XL and that was accurate.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This shape-wear is not very sturdy and the ribbing was incredibly floppy and kept rolling down. I ordered a small and even though it was somewhat tight, it provided no compression and creased in weird places as I wore it. After wearing it one time, threads were coming off and the seams were coming undone.You would be better to spend your money on Spanx for a real result and lasting quality.

  This looks even better in person. It fit me perfectly and I could not be happier. 5'1"" 140 lbs. 39x29x40 and medium fit like a glove. Has adjustable straps to fit the chest area and the tie is adjustable to fit your body. I am very happy with my purchase

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So comfy. So sexy. Buy the stockings if you need them so you can put this on for your partner ASAP. I'm a curvy lady, 46, 37, 46. The XL fits perfectly and enhances my curves while covering my belly. Lots of confidence wearing this!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I loved it, it made my bigger built body look amazingly hot if I do say so myself, however, one of the garter belt clips broke before I could show it off! Such a disappointment. My fiance' was a trooper but I still was super disappointed.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It served its purpose

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fit like thought it would

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The color was an orange red instead of a true red. Also, it was to short for my torso.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Tiny size

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôve ordered many lingerie items on Amazon over the years and I must say that this is one of the best. The quality is great. The lace tie back is not flimsy but a thicker strap. I LOVE this style, it is so sexy and comfortable to wear. I ordered my usual size small and it fits perfectly. Overall I highly recommend this lingerie and plan on getting more colors. **Thanks for reading my review & hope it helps make your decision easier**

  I received mine after seeing a review saying these are short. I am happy to report they are not. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô5‚Äù tall with very long legs and the one size covers them well. I actually had to snug up the straps on my new 12 strap garter belt. These are also very sheer and comfortable.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought these in the ""nude"" shade which should more accurately be called ""ripe peach"" because it is certainly not nude.  These seem loose and oversized to the point where I was getting the elephant skin look even when using a garter belt. The quality seems flimsy although they haven't torn or run yet.  I will be returning these.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I have bought the nude, black, and the tan pair. I wear a garter belt to hold up my stockings and the stockings are really nice they are not silk and that makes them more durable my opinion. I wear them once and then I wash them in my sink with dish soap soaking in the sink and then I rinse them out and I lay them on a table flat. To me they don't lose their shape because I only wear them once and wash them. I got the Plus size since my weight is about 220 but they do seem a light fit but I rather have a light fit then a tight fit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These fit as expected and did not run, but WOW did they stretch out. I only wore them for a very short time, less than 2 hours, and they just have no elasticity at all. Once you stretch it, it's done - there's no going back. Definitely a one time only use item.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These stockings fit well - I'm 5'9"" and around 150 - but the material is awful. They snag on everything. Threads caught all over my hands and pulled out while putting them on with reasonable care. These are about the quality of $5 stockings back when you could easily find plain stockings for use with a suspender/garter belt. Far too costly for the quality. If you decide to buy them, wear some cotton or satin gloves when you put them on and be very careful of rubbing your legs against anything - even just fabric upholstery.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered a pair of these ""one size fits most"" and a pair of plus size both from Leg Ave. I have thick thighs and have always struggled to find thigh highs that fit and stay up. I think these and the plus size will both be fine with garters, as they want to roll up on their own without the support. But, SURPRISE, both the one size and the plus size fit me in pretty much the same way. These might have been slightly tighter, but certainly not like I expected once I received the plus size pair first and tried them on and saw how well they fit. Sounds like an issue for both the small petites with slim thighs that would likely find this pair too loose for them and the thick ladies with curvy thighs that need the extra room that they might not find in the plus size pair since I'm still rather small and they fit me comfortably. However, if you're unlikely small percentage of women that is 5'0"" 130-140lb like me with a curvy body and thick thighs, then hey, kudos, because either pair will work great for you!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These did not fit comfortably over the widest part of my thighs (pants size 16) and kept rolling down. Luckily my wedding was virtual, so nobody saw them falling down except for my groom!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fit was horrible, slides down, even with a garter it looks big. Quality was poor and they already arrived with snags. It‚Äôs also a non-returnable item.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Sorry but the fit wasn‚Äôt good at all.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It's hard to find stockings for use with suspender belts, most these days have silicon grip bands at the top to ""stay up"" which is never a flattering look. These are exactly what they say they are - stockings, no ""stay up"" grips, for use with suspender belt. They're okay quality, nothing out of the ordinary but look fine and were exactly what I needed for the Christmas party.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Would like to see them modelled on someone who has regular size legs.  They are far too long for me as I am not a model with legs that go on forever.  Stocking manufacturers and garter belt manufacturers ought to get together so they meet in the middle comfortably rather than having them too close together.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I think over all for under 10$ they are a good buy. I'm outside the weight suggestions for my height and weight to be wearing the queen size but they fit fine, even by the end of the night being a little big (even after a wash). As someone else has said they are delicate. But over all if you are just wearing them for a special evening at home you'll likely be satisfied.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It's very smooth, feels great to wear.  I'm always afraid to put a rip or run, but with a little care these have been worn many times so far without disappointment.  Great value and quality! will buy again.

  The product was NOT what I expected but I was still NOT disappointed.It's my fault for not reading the description clearly . I was expecting a solid nude color bra with matching nude mesh just at the top and black lace over the solid part of the bra .The whole bra is transparent and mesh . Not just a few parts. So it's more of lingerie than casual wear in my opinion .Seeing that the whole bra is mesh, I was expecting it to be flimsy and not hold up . Me being a plus sized girl . To my surprise the bra is really well made . I tried it on and it fits snug in a good way !The back straps hold in my little back fats , the arm straps are thick and sturdy , the wire underneath seems to be sturdy as well and the best part is that it is NOT itchy !I'm definitely going to be wearing this for my boyfriend but have now search for a casual wear bra once again.Not what I was looking for but it was a nice little surprise .

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This does not fit at all like the picture.  It was absolutely nowhere near full coverage and gave me a very odd shape.  Kind of like a flattened on top half and sticking out on the bottom half. Quite bizarre and I‚Äôve never seen a bra fit like this before.  And i‚Äôm not droopy at all but this bra made me look like I was. The material is also very, very thin so do not expect this to be a bra you would wear often or for long periods of time. Seems like it would rip quite easily. It‚Äôs such a shame because I really liked the way it looked in the picture.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am overjoyed. For someone with my breast shape (teardrop) this is IDEAL. Some people haven‚Äôt loved the shaping (often mesh/lace bras can make my chest look weirdly squashed or otherwise so I get it), but if you also have a teardrop shape it will probably feel great!It came in my fairly uncommon size (36DDD) and it provided a level of support that felt like the hands of angels were holding me up with zero push-up padding or anything similar.As someone who felt stuck with expensive bra brands because not a lot of brands offered my size, I could not be more ecstatic that I could get this AMAZING, high-quality bra for just $15 and not compromise on size at all.1. I‚Äôm buying it in red.2. I‚Äôm ordering even more stuff from this brand to try ASAP!3. It‚Äôs so gorgeous on top of being incredibly functional and I am brainstorming ways to Seinfeld-style Wear It As A Top.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Nice & sturdy bra, I love the straps they're thick & made of very good fabric & the bra holds me up PERFECTLY which is much needed for the size cup that I have. I'll definitely keep reordering this bra again& in more color's

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Beautiful bra and fit the look I was going for

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This bra is super cute. However, the wire goes up so far on the sides that it is uncomfortable to wear.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  When I bought this bra I was looking for a pretty bra that fit with medium support, and comfortable enough to wear all day.‚Ä¢What I like: the fit is spot on! No gaps and I‚Äôm not popping out the top. The price is fantastic, it‚Äôs so difficult to find less expensive bras in my size. The hooks in the back feel sturdy I don‚Äôt think anything is going to break free. The underwire does feel comfortable.‚Ä¢What I am ok with: She is SEE THROUGH. I can tell this bra is going to be a mostly ‚Äúspecial occasion bra‚Äù and she is gonna need to be hand washed because she feels DELICATE.‚Ä¢What I wish was better: As for comfort, I don‚Äôt see this as being an ‚Äúall day‚Äù bra. She‚Äôs a little pinchy in the straps and a little itchy on the skin. I wish she was more supportive, I feel like the girls are sagging lower then I want them to. Also the straps are a bit too thin for this busty girl to be comfortable in and the length of the straps is a little short.All said I will probably be buying the red one solely for the price and the fact it fits me.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I really love how this bra fits and covers. I ordered a 36c, most bras I‚Äôm on the last row of hooks but this one seems to fight tighter and very little stretch to it so I have to go with the last hooks. I ended up liking how they fit so much that I am going to order 2 more. After having 4 kids it‚Äôs hard to find a bra that holds them in and this one does the job well. The lace around the front is thin but covers nicely. There is wire support but it‚Äôs very wide and sewn in nicely so I doubt it‚Äôs going to poke out any time soon ,like most my wire bras end up doing. I will absolutely purchase this again!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was in search of a bra with full coverage, wide straps, excellent support, with an underwire (for adequate separation to avoid 'uniboob'), NOT a minimizer ( I don't want smaller boobs, I want supported boobs). Choosing this one was a last ditch attempt (after 4 significantly more expensive online purchases that had to be returned) to get what I wanted. In the photos, this bra didn't look like it would do the trick, but I gave it a shot anyway, and wow, am I glad I did. It does everything I need it to do, and it is surprisingly comfortable (not as comfortable as my Cacique, but really, nothing is), all for under $25! I'll be buying a few more of these. For the price, I can't go wrong!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Ok for context I am 5 ft 8 44ddd chest  37 waist and 46 hip. I take a 16 in usa sizes. Xxl or 1x in tops. I have 43 inch underbust and measure 50 inches full chest around.  I take a 44 ddd in usa sizes. However online I usually go up a size in cup.  I ordered a 44 G and it fits perfectly.  It was not sheer and covered any private areas. It gives enough coverage as to not be like a demi bra and give you alot of unneeded cleavage. Very tasteful unstated sexy.  I recommend.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am a G cup and I have so much trouble finding PRETTY bras that are comfy and actually fit.This bra is very affordable, and while it‚Äôs not the most high quality bra, you get what pay for.The little ribbon detail and the gems in the ribbon is so cute. The underwire does NOT dig in, which is a common problem for me, and there is absolutely no spillage!! Great bra!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  glad I bought this one on sale, it looks way better off than on, it gives a very water balloon shape to your breasts, and not attractive for larger breast in my opinion, but it could be all in what your use to wearing too. I would not recommend this Bra for larger heavy breasted women.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love these bras! I‚Äôve boughten a few now and love the cost comparison to other larger sized bras. I was sick of paying $60+++ for bras that don‚Äôt last more then 2-3 months. This bra fits well and looks very sexy as well.

  NOT PLUS SIZE FRIENDLY!!! I found these looking specifically for plus size harnesses and they hurt like hell! So not sexy. Do NOT advertise that one size fits all when you don't cater to plus sizes! They are not that stretchy!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super slutty. The wife looks hot as hell with them on

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I have to wear these inside out because whatever was used for the stitching is awful. I wore one for about ten minutes and could already feel it rubbing me raw. Flipped it inside out and was fine, since it's black it wasn't noticeable unless you were really looking closely.The designs are cute and have a lot of stretch so they will fit a variety of builds. Overall I am ok with the purchase but do to the stitching would probably not purchase again from this manufacturer

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  As a bigger woman I have a hard time finding sexy bras. So adding these does the trick. I feel sexy and trendy. I wear a 36DDD and these fit just fine.They are thick enough and stretchy enough that they aren't uncomfortable and are durable. If you're trying to keep it a hidden secret then you may not want to wear these under light, tight, or sheer clothing.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Seems well made...but.....not made for tig ol bitties!!  üòÇ üçà üçà

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm a plus size gal size 20, 38 double dd bra. These were comfortable and some parts adjustable. The one that wraps around the under bust is. The strap on the one that wraps around the neck is also. They have a small hook on the back so you don't have to slide over you head. If one had to uncomfortable it would be the one that wraps around the neck. It was the second strap that gave me issues. It kept sliding up instead of staying in place. A little bit of clothing tape could fix this. All in all they looked amazing. Fair for the price. I'm not wearing these everyday. It's for a halloween costume. I'm not sure about the overall longevity. Every single one fit well.

  Fabric is smooth and honestly it feels very 50 shadesüòá I had to go back and look at the pictures to see how one of them was supposed to be worn. But this is a buy that you will love, or your spouse/partner/onlooker/room full of strangers will be pondering about.A couple friends of mine ordered the same thing after they saw it and felt the material.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm very happy with this product for the price!I‚Äôm a size L and have size 38D boobs and these fit perfect using the adjustable straps.I had to pull up the pictures to see how they were to be worn, but no complaints here.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So I‚Äôm a 2x and a 38DD so I went into this quite skeptical that it would fit me in the slightest and if it did they would look terrible.Let me say I‚Äôve never been more happy to be wrong!! The straps are completely adjustable and even get too big for me on the looser settings and fit so snugly and comfortably- not to mention they look cute as heck.Only thing I‚Äôd take one star away for is that the straps do almost start to roll around the ribcage but I am a bigger girl so take it with a grain of salt :))

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I found no issues with this product. I am 26C and they all fit well! Feels like a bra. Also the packaging was well done and I didn‚Äôt have to look at photos to figure it out as other reviewers stated. All of them fit well, the choker one fit around my head with no issues and I have an average size head! Super hot and add the extra ‚Äúbondage‚Äù feel while out with my partner. Brings an outfit up from cute to sexy. Tip: If you have any itchy spots where the stitching hits your skin, lightly use a nail file to rub the fabric a bit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Wicked product, seeing the misses dressed in this for my birthday. Just enough to make her chest pop and more then enough material to grab well ramming her from behind. Fluids wiped off easily with no staining, doubled as a whip and choker.Would recomend for wife, girlfriend, or mistress. Just not all at the same time.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I would love to review these but I received a Yu-Gi-Oh DVD instead of the harnesses. Not even close!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I absolutely love these harnesses, comfy, easy to resize for comfort, just everything I wanted from the products. Absolutely love them, they fit, feel and look so amazing.*edit* I am a 36 C/D and I absolutely loved each one, they fit like gloves! But, for my boobs. Boob gloves. I love them, a lot!

  Edit, two years later!This lingerie is still fantastic! It's lasted well, without any of the lace falling apart or becoming scratchy. It's stood the test of several costumes, as well as getting rave reviews in my love life. I bought another color about a year ago (red), which was a great vibrant color, exactly as pictured, and felt and fit the same as the first one. I may just buy another color this year!2019 review:Oh my god. This is great. I'm 5'1"" and about 275lbs, which I carry around my lower belly, butt, and thighs. I purchased the 4X. This item is amazing. It fit perfectly. Some things to note in particular:- It's not scratchy. It's very comfortable. Sometimes lace and fishnet material gets scratchy, but this is not just comfortable but borders on soft.- The crotch snaps are barely noticeable. You know they're there, because you saw them or used them to put it on, but you can't feel them when the item is actually on.- The straps are adjustable. This really helped me because I was able to adjust the straps so the top of the teddy actually held my boobs in place (I wear a 42DD).I'm just honestly really overwhelmed. I ordered this item to use for Halloween, and I had my doubts. It didn't have very many reviews, but it was a low price, so I went for it. It came within two days (Prime), fit exactly like I wanted it to, and, the cherry on top, it was a low price. I highly recommend this. Plus size girls gotta stick together, so I made sure to write this review right after trying it on.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm very happily surprised at how nice this is for the price! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù currently 140 Lbs & 34D. I‚Äôve gained 10-15 lbs recently and carry that weight in my belly and chest so I wanted something to cover that.  I have a short torso and this fits great lengthwise so I‚Äôm not sure if it would be great for someone that‚Äôs taller, but there are adjustable straps to give a little extra room. There is no support in the bust, but with the way it‚Äôs low cut, it still looks great. Also, fits awesome on the butt. It cuts high up and doesn‚Äôt leave anything to the imagination in the back, but with the front covered, that‚Äôs a plus. I‚Äôm surprised at how soft it is too!Only con is that it smells like chemicals. I hand washed it in the sink and it bled badly. I‚Äôd suggest only handwashing for this reason.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 190lbs and I got this in a XL. I LOVEEE this! I felt very confident and sexy when I tried it on and my boyfriend liked it too!! I wanna wear this everyday

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'9 165lbs. 40,35,43 measurements. I ordered the Xl and the fit is amazing. The quality is suprising for the cost. The lace is soft and silky, not itchy like some other lace lingerie I have purchased. The button closures are quality. The color is exactly as advertised. Excellent quality and find for a cheap price!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Loved this body suit! It fit like a glove great quality!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I absolutely love this outfit. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 145 lbs with 36 DDDs at my age I‚Äôm super proud of them üòù. I got a large and it fit good. Little loose on the rear cause all my goods are up top (unfortunately). I paired this with a black mini shirt and strapped heels for a night out.  I threw over a white button up just in case people said anything.  I‚Äôve never felt sexier.  My husband was happy.  Win win

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'3 and 150lbs. Womens size 6/8. I am hippy. The medium is way too tight down below, but I bought this as lingerie so, it serves its purpose. I could never wear it out in day light with an outfit. The V comes way further down below than the photos portray. But I do realize that I may need a large. But again, its fine for me. I would say order a size up. The material and quality is as expected. Thank u!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Really happy with this item! I am 5'6"" and a 42D cup and a size 20 in pants, I wear a 1 or 2 in stores like Torrid for panties, I carry all my weight in my tummy due to diastasis recti. I wish this had just a liiiiiiittle more chest support, but the cleavage angle is flattering anyway. The lace is a nice thickness and I like the strategic panels that offer peekaboo but not totally sheer. I ordered a 4X and I don't think changing size would make a difference; it fit just right in terms of tightness, not uncomfortable but not too loose either. I may buy it in more colors! It came in a frosted plastic zip-top bag.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great quality and fast delivery ! Fits perfect to my size !!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  survived in the drier but should air dry, dress to success in the bedroom ;)

  Fits perfect!!!

  Color: BlackPurchased Size: SmallI am 5'5"", 135 lbs, and a 34D. I typically wear a standard, US women's size 4.I purchased this for a Britney Spears costume. It was actually very comfortable to wear. Overall, the fit was true to size for me.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  A very cute and sexy skirt with a ton of potential, but it wouldn't even cover 1/2 of my wife's bottom even when she was standing straight.  She wanted super short, and is not shy, but there is just no way anyone could ever wear this except maybe over a bikini, which defeats the ""flirt"" purpose.  5'2""  with full hips, so got a size Large: Front length hits 1.5"" below crotch (okay), but the back would need another 4 inches just to reach down to a point that a full 1.5"" of cheek would show.  Unfortunately, we had to return it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  my sister should not be allowed to wear this

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Actually an impressive skirt, nice material. Other than a comment saying 'skirt fits as regular size' I didn't see a size chart per se, but i used my/the standard (US) size(s)... & its two thumbs up Perfect!! I like the mini skirt style, material, fit.. Very pleased üåπ Well made/stitches, nice pleaded skirt. üëç

  This skirt is absolutely adorable and fits great! I would recommend this for sure.

  I honestly thought it was going to be too big on the bust part due to the fact I have no breast but the fit was amazing (I got a small btw ;))

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'5, about 155 lb, 34B bra, with an hourglass/ athletic shape.I'm not comfortable to share a photo, but it looks so good that I could!The top fits perfect Medium for a 34B! I like that the straps sit wide and hide my armpit pudge.The bottoms are a little small, but very sexy. They're not tight, just less fabric... I have a huge butt and big thighs, so I was satisfied that the bottoms don't cut into my hips or give me ""muffin top"" at all. But yeah, they're teeny-tiny/ low rise.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Absolutely love this set! Looks great if you have a small chest (like me!). I read several reviews from Shein, Romwe and on Amazon before ordering to figure out what size to get. I‚Äôm usually a small for tops and a med/lg for bottoms (135lbs). The large fit me perfectly! I do have A cups so I don‚Äôt quite fill out the bra, but if it was any smaller it wouldn‚Äôt be able to strap around my chest comfortably. Overall, with the straps loosened all the way, it looks gorgeous. Love love love it. Cannot wait to show this to my boyfriend for V-day!EDIT: Strap in the front snapped when I tried it on for V-Day and Amazon REFUSES to  exchange it. Amazon is also demanding the broken set be returned to them, even though they apparently cannot exchange it since it was sold through a different seller. Honestly this is Amazon‚Äôs fault more than Shein‚Äôs, go ahead and purchase through shein.com and not here in case you have any issues!

  Me encanta como me queda el conjunto, la talla es exactamente c√≥mo lo indica.El material es muy c√≥modo y muy sexy para una ocasi√≥n especial.La tela es de buena calidad, creo que compar√© en otros colores :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I wanted a basic sexy set so this was exactly what i needed! I am between a medium and large so I ordered both. I found that both fit well for my body type. (The medium is without fishnets and the one with the fishnets is a large)  I obviously feel more comfortable in the large since i have a bit of a wiggle room with the adjustable straps but also with the large I am at the most tightest length. The medium looks good as well! buuut what I did find was that the size large panties fit WAY better than the medium (it just doesn't cover my majora/mound as much) and the chest in medium fits WAY better than the large. SO if you are like me, i would honestly just recommend the medium since its tight and you can adjust the bra. (and maybe pair it with some other cute panties)  ALSO don't speak for all! always measure yourself before!!This might have been a confusing insight, but overall it is such a cute set that I know ill shrink into. and they pair well with fishnets! (also on amazon)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am have a classic hour-glass figure. I purchased a small, the bottom fits well, but the top is WAY TOO SMALL. Plus, there is no way to adjust anything on either piece. I am keeping the set because it‚Äôs not worth the trouble to return it, and I can still wear the bottom. All in all, not worth the money in my opinion. I could just purchase a pair of bottom like this for less.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered this in red as well as black. They both fit great.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs cute but if I move my arms up the top looks weird. Just doesn‚Äôt stay in place well because of the way the band is set up. It‚Äôs also a little too big but I‚Äôm small so

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  SO CUTE! I'm quite petite and find lingerie usually looks baggy and is hard to feel confident in but this fits me so well! I'm 5'4 and weigh about 110 pounds. it runs small, I got an s but usually wear xs and there's no extra baggage room anywhere. super cute for an intimate night.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Items are not the same as pictured. I bought the white in medium. It is absolutely hideous in person. The fit is terrible. There‚Äôs zero quality to this item and it boggles my mind as to how this set has such high ratings.I‚Äôm a 34DD.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Lo compr√© para mi novia y le gust√≥ y a mi me encant√≥.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Took a long time to ship:/// my tibbies would out the bottom some times. Not super comfortable

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The set is fabulous and true to size. Loving the fit and color.

  Im a curvy size 6 and wear a 36C, this bodysuit has just the right amount of stretch to wear comfortably. Super sexy set with beautiful complementing details, if you‚Äôre thinking about it just buy it! It‚Äôs worth it ;)

  This is probably the best piece of lingerie I‚Äôve ever bought. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 145 not a perfect body by any means but this thing looks amazing on me! It sits high up on the hips which is super sexy, also it‚Äôs tight but in a good way, holds my breasts up high making them look more flattering. I think I need one in every color. Buy this you won‚Äôt regret it.Lingerie companies should take notes from this one. Absolutely never had a piece look this good on me. In love and hopefully my boyfriend thinks so too üòä

  If you are thinking about buying this but you aren't sure... JUST BUY IT. It's gorgeous, hides my tummy and fits me perfect. I did size up one size. For reference, I am 5'8"" and 200 lbs and bought an xxl. I bought two other lingerie pieces in the same order and this is by far my favorite. Just buy it ladies. It's amazing and you will feel sexy af in it ‚ò∫Ô∏è

  I am 5‚Äô3 and I generally wear M size, I ordered M, The material is nice,  I am flat chested and it looks great on me and it makes me feel beautiful; but it runs a little bit small, it is not noticeable if you look yourself at the mirror, but you will feel it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  For the price ($16) it‚Äôs not bad. But overall, I don‚Äôt really like it. It‚Äôs too small in places and too big in places. As soon as I took it out of the packaging it was falling apart. The fabric was coming undone. I washed it like you would, only washer no dryer, and it fell apart even more. The crotch slit goes all the way up to my stomach and I don‚Äôt know why. Awkward fit. Wouldn‚Äôt buy again.

  Tried on this little number for my bf and of course his mouth DROPPED! The top fit very well and looked even more amazing with my push-up underneath it. Also got compliments when when I wore the top with some high-waisted jeans.Bottoms: I pulled up the sides on the bottom for a little more comfort around my waist. I‚Äôm a bit bottom heavy so that area looked great too.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  it does not even go over my knees & the top doesn‚Äôt fit either smh. don‚Äôt buy unless you are skin and bones

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Stretch is good and I suppose the value is correct for the product itself. Would have given a 4star review, but the underwear are not the same as in the picture...disappointing because I like the style of panty this is supposed to come with. Otherwise looks sexy. Beware of them rolling up on you tho, particularly around the waist and band under chest rolls up.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It came in the mail pretty fast and it looks like the picture. It‚Äôs one size fits all but it‚Äôs stretchy so it should frame your body shape. Very see through. Wear something under. Over all, good purchase.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This looks great in the photo. I wear this type of lingerie all the time. Cheap, stretchy, disposable, and flattering. This one I actually sent back. It looked bizarre on and I am of average build.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is a bit difficult to figure out at first. The material is like a nylon so it looks odd in package. Top looked like pants.I wore this for my husband and he loved it. I slept in it and it didn't bother me at all.Super sexy even without big breasts. üòç

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  When I first opened the package I thought ""How in the h*ll is this supposed to fit me?!?!"", but man does this stretch! And it's not itchy like most mesh lingerie! My man LOVED it and it made me feel a bit more confident to hide my tummy a little :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  HOT outfit! Looks amazing on my boobies! But the arms were too tight. That‚Äôs more of a me problem though LOL. Might rip of the arms and wear it as a tube top kind of thing. But I love it. It stretches A LOOOOOT.

  Seriously!!!!! These weren't taken off, they were ripped off !!!! They are absolutely the perfect fit. When I first got them, I thought I would have to send them back, but I didn't have to. I do wish they came in a pack of 3 or 4 with different sayings. These didn't last long, lol!!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My wife really loves these panties, but would love them even more if they were crotches panties, so it would make 4 play more easier, if your company would make these panties crotches, we would purchase more of them, and I would suggest that you do so other customers would love this idea, and you should make this kinda underwear for men besides, with a crotchless opening for men, my idea, your company would sell a whole lot more of these underwear for men and women or couples ok,thank you for reading this.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Still waiting for the wife to put these on after over a month, but I give myself an A for effort.  Lol.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  First off I ordered 3...love them all.. this company took time out of their busy day to discuss sizes to ensure the proper fit, that to me folks is excellant customer service and shows they care.. I am 5'4 200lbs  bought XXL. They are a little snug and showy, but thats what I expected/wanted. This size is 1 size bigger than my norm. I highly reccomend ordering a size up a size and if you want more coverage 2 sizes up...Have a blast!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My husband purchased these for me as a small gift with other various naughties. üòò Absolutely love them! They feel amazing but they were slightly more snug then I wanted them to be. He bought medium and they are cotton so I'm sure after the first wash they will shrink lol. If they last after use anyway!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  All of the tracking messages I received while waiting on this product to arrive openly referred to the product by the intimate text inscribed on the panties.  In my case, each text message I received openly included the exact words inscribed  on the panties!  There was no attempt to abbreviate or conceal the text that might be perceived as vulgar when viewed out of context!  And, the panties are much larger for a given size that most US retail.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I always listen to my wife so when I read the message I jumped.  I am a nice guy like that.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 165lbs, 5'6"" and got a large. They fir perfectly! They are really comfortable and of course fun! I machine washed mine inside out and dried in the dryer. They did not fade or shrink. I bought two pairs and love them both... It puts a little fun in the relationship.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The bottoms didn't fit but we didn't need them.Bought this for my girlfriend and now she's my wife.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Cute but the back/bottom is kinda weirdly shaped. Not a huge deal tho moo

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fit perfectly! Super cute and the best touch for my costume!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Extremely difficult to get all the parts on. A thong is a horrible, poor choice of panty for the manufacturer to sew a heavy tail to. Absolutely no support in the top. Who decided that SQUARE shaped bras are sexy? Breasts are ROUND, not square! Not flattering at all, and not for big tiddies either! (38DD)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Plus size:16-18 here 5‚Äô0 about 210-220lbs undies didn‚Äôt fit. Bought a white thong and sewed a button on the back! Easy! It stretched great and looked great! I think maybe if you‚Äôre petite and closer to 300 it may not be as flattering. It‚Äôs you‚Äôre taller and closer to 300 it should fit other than underwear. Socks did not go up to thighs but plus size, lol didn‚Äôt expect it. I left them just under the knee and looks cute!! I liked it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought the ‚Äúmaid‚Äù and ‚Äúmaid jumpsuit‚Äù. For the first one, the thong won‚Äôt make it past my thighs, so I can‚Äôt wear that. The stockings are also tight and can‚Äôt wear them. The rest is cute. The jumpsuit is just okay. I‚Äôm a 36B, but the strap that goes across the breasts doesn‚Äôt feel that comfy. It gives a ‚Äúmuffin top‚Äù affect to my boobs. If you have areolas larger than an inch, it won‚Äôt cover them. And if I slide the strap to my underbust, I feel like my boobs look a little too squished together in a not so flattering way. The crotch area is also a little tight. In a way that it could feel good, but looks weird lol. It‚Äôs like a reverse wedgie. These items would probably flatter smaller body types better. I normally wear a m/l for tops and l/xl for bottoms.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Listen I understand wanting this, I was hesitant about it and rightfully so so many people complained about the size, the bottoms, the collar and even the bra (if you can call it that) but I got anyways when I got money and let me just say; please do not get this. The bottoms were so small it looked so stupid on if your coochie got just a little chub to it DONT BUY IT even if it does go on it won‚Äôt fit well and if you got a tummy it‚Äôll accentuate it and make it even more noticeable. The collar was small did not fit (mind you I‚Äôm 5,1 and a lil above average body weight) the tights were cute, the hat was cute, the tail was cheap and was falling apart, the bow collar that goes with the other collar broke, got a lot of random scrunchy things which is cute I guess and they approve was cute, the top part was annoying and would move a lot and I was scared of tightening it and breaking it. All in all if you are thinking about getting the bikini one, please keep in mind that it most likely will break the minute you use it or not even fit. They should make bigger sizes or something because for 30 bucks you would think they would come for all sizes ya know or atleast looking at the model.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  this is so cute!!!! brings everything so many cute accessories i love it the top fits perfect its the right amount of coverage i have a C cup and it fits fine the headband is so cute and so are the tights the only thing is the bottom didnt fit me at all its super tiny but i can easily switch it out with something else i love this outfit im really glad i bought it <3

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits a bit off, and tying the back is a little strange, but this was a first for me, so maybe I've no idea how to wear it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love iiiit!Super cuteüôà

  When I first got them I was disappointed.. The packages were vacuumed sealed and the red dye from the bow stained the white tights. I was willing to over look that.. my husband didn't notice. 2. When I put them on they barely came above my knees I'm only 5'2 and 125 pounds. 3. They kept rolling down my leg.  Instantly thought what a waste of money. Soo. Waited a couple of days and tried the black and red bow pair. Much better fit I loved it. I decided to wash them and the bows came off of both pairs. üò≠.. very disappointed.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Got them for my girl they are thin for sure but she likes that but the only reason 3 stars the bows are glued on (poorly) may i add but a lil bit og gorilla glue fixed that she is 5'3 and about 125-130 so a lil thick on the lower region and they are nice on her

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  They only go right above my knees and they will not go any further my I'm a size 8 in pants and I'm 5' 4. it's not like the picture shows. They are really tight at the top.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am really unhappy with these items. I made this purchase a bit ago but I just now needed them and the bows are glued on. I mean are you kidding me. It's fabric you so not glue. I really am just unseat with these items. More shocked then anything on the quality

||||||||||||||||||||||||




                    The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†If you have relatively thick thighs (like mine are big for my body but not that big) then I‚Äôd call these more thigh lows as they sit best a few inches above the knee. The bows are simply hot glued on but with some simple well hidden stitching down while they are on they are great! Although it will gunk up your needle so be prepared to throw it away afterwards! Also I recommend some pliers because the center part of the bow and hot glue makes it hard for the needle to go through

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love, love, love!I'm 5 foot tall, so they fit around my upper thighs perfectly!I have big thighs, I was pleasantly surprised at the comfortable fit.Very good quality!Arrived on time.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Wore these for literally an hour before one of the bows fell off. You pay for what you get lol. They were cheap so it‚Äôs no big deal but if you buy them I‚Äôd recommend sewing the bow on or hot gluing it because it seemed like it was never stuck to the fabric in the first place. Also kinda tight on the thighs but you sort of want that so they don‚Äôt slide down. They roll on themselves easily though. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, 112 pounds, and more of an athletic build so my thighs are a pretty normal circumference (so it must not be my fault). Long ass review for some cheap stockings. Not sure why I took the time to write this. Just maybe buy different stockings if you‚Äôre looking at these.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  i love these socks! they came quick after shipping, and they're very comfortable and worth the price. they're stretchy, which i was happy for since a lot of socks aren't that suited for thick thighs and more for thinner legs. my only complaint is that the bag it came in was vacuum sealed, which caused the full white and full black pairs to be wrinkly upon opening. the bows break off very easily and the top is a little tight around my thigh, but it should be expected. but, still a great purchase and i will be buying other packs.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I received these 2 days ago. There were red stains in quite a few places. I think it may be because they were compressed in a vacuum sealed bag and the red dye has leaked from the now onto the white bow. I was very disappointed as I loved the black pairs and thought the white socks' material was lovely. I am hoping to be sent another pair that isn't stained as I loved the product or to have a refund.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I brought these to go with a linguine set! One pair had a hole in the sock before I even got to wear it.As soon as it goes in the washer them bows fall off. There good for ladies with larger legs as I was worried they wouldnt get that far.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Was excited when these got delivered as they are cute, put a pair on today, unfortunately the sizing is all wrong I'm a size 8/10 so ordered small like it recommended for my size, I cannot wear them as stockings as they cut my circulation off contest way to wear them is as knee socks, n to top it off the how's are coming off even on the other pairs I have worn.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  They came as expected, comfortable but if you have bigger legs I would avoid as they are quite tight

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Just fit over knee, tight on band round my leg. Would not reorder because of this fact

  I bought these a couple years ago for Halloween and didn't take them out of the package until I got to my destination and surprise, they were so tight I could hardly breathe. For reference, when I wore them I was 23, 5'5"", 110 lbs, pant size 0...I didn't think it was possible for anything to make me look fat, but somehow the tops of these stockings are so painfully tight, that they pushed whatever ""fat"" I had on my thighs up and over the top and created a bulge. Unless these come in different sizes, there is no way the girl in the picture isn't photoshopped. These tights will surely not slip down and in the process of holding them up like they are glued to you, they will leave super painful marks on your legs and cut off your circulation.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  If you have the legs of a stork, an ostrich, and emu or a flamingo, these are for you. I don't know what possessed me to order these without reading the reviews. I just went back and read them and it seems I'm not alone.The thigh highs cannot possibly go all the way up my legs. I am 5'4"", a size 4/6. I don't even think I could have fit these when I was a size 2. They are that small. The band at the top is extremely tight. I couldn't even wear them just above my knees.I am so disappointed because I've wanted a pair of these for years. Now that I have a pair, I'll have to find a pair that fits.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm a petite 5‚Äô1‚Äù size 0 but these are too tight on my thighs and roll down. Might have a lot to do with being so short because they come all the way up to my butt lol. If you are 5‚Äô5‚Äù or taller they will probably work with a durable garter belt! Super cute though and didn‚Äôt get any noticeable snags. I wore them twice.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love these stockings.  Leg Avenue has definitely gained I life long customer, they fit very nice. Exactly the right height and your garter definitely brings sexy home. Just a well made product.. and many compliments out and about and at the office... definitely makes you feel like a million bucks.. and very pretty toe design that looks wonderful with open toe heels..really the only stockings I've ever worn with open toes and wedge sandals.  But cute all the same.. enjoy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These stockings fit a little loose up by my thighs. Unless I get attachments to my panties I‚Äôm concerned I will pull these up all night. The overall look is great for the value.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Although these stockings snag very easily, the are super cute. This is not a pair that you could wash and re-wear though. I don‚Äôt think they would hold up.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love these! They will need something to hold them up, there's no sticky part on the top. They fit perfectly and seem to be good quality. I don't have skinny thighs and they don't squeeze at all.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The proportions are a lot off.  The laced part has elastic, and that part is too tight, so it makes a weird dent in your inner thigh.  The actual stocking is too big, as in it's a bit loose, and also quite high...so you have to pull these to your upper thigh, but because the lace is off it just makes a weird shape.  It looks great on their model, but in person, the lacy part is pretty thick material (which I guess is good for much garter belt use), doesn't stay up on its own, and is too tight.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love these! Exactly as advertised. Good quality. Only thing is, I'm 5""11. They look like they're thigh high but they can literally be pulled all the as to my crotch. So I guess hahaha they're not as shown Exactly but just as cute.

  When I tell you this compliments us plus size Girls IT DOES! At first when you get it, your in disbelief (is this really going to fit my body?) then BOOM! start putting the stocking on with NO ISSUES! I‚Äôm 6‚Äô0 and thick so if I can pull it over my body you can as well! Overall I LOVE IT! & will be ordering more different styles! I put this at the top of my lingerie GO TO List!

  I NeVeR leave reviews. In fact, this is the first time I‚Äôve reviewed anything. I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô10, size 14-16 and can never find anything that makes me feel confident. The stretch is amazing and it‚Äôs pretty soft for what it is. I plan to get more from this seller.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very flattering for a boudoir photo shoot I did. Appears that it won‚Äôt fit but fishnet is very stretchy and it doesn‚Äôt make you embrace your curves!

  ¬†This was worth the purchase. Fits true to size, very comfortable and great quality.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I have never tried a bodystocking.  Omg I am in love with this.  The lace is soft and super stretchy.  I am 4‚Äô11 and it fit my body like a dream.  The lace never once ripped when I put it on.  It‚Äôs well put together.  I love how there is a solid piece on the toes so the fishnet doesn‚Äôt bother your feet.  Came in a nice bag.  The hubby loved this piece on me very much.  It hit and shaped my body nicely.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is an amazing and soft product. I love the design and how it just exudes sexiness. My boyfriends exact words‚Äù i can‚Äôt wait to take this off of you‚Äù! Ladies this is a winner. It shipped quickly and customer service was superb.Just be careful when putting it on to not rip any of the details!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am normally a size 3x & I was worried this wouldn‚Äôt fit. It fit perfectly & im happy with this purchase

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My husband loves it. The hole was big enough to where it didn‚Äôt rub him uncomfortably. We‚Äôve had issues in the past with some body suits that made it uncomfortable for him. This was perfect!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This set is amazing it fits perfectly, would advise to buy separate thongs, but it's a lovely set, very comfortable,

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It is tight around my thighs but I expected that. It's a hit with my husband!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Guy guy guy ! I will get more of these feels lovely on and looks amazing !

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Arrived one day earlier, it fits any size as they are quite elastic so I could say I'm happy with everything.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this lingerie! If you are looking for sexy, then this is the one. It fits me perfectly. At first I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would fit because it looks small when you take it out the packaging but it stretches so well and then once it‚Äôs on, it hugs my body as it should.

  I ending up buying a medium. I am a 36B chest.  It fit great.  I felt very supported for a soft bra.  I was not uncomfortable at all.  Wore it all day long under a long sleeved tee shirt.  I didn't feel like nipples could be seen.  And I didn't feel like my girls were drooping. Although since they are only B cups, they're pretty perky on their own.  That being said, it may not be so supportive to those with real, larger breasts.  But I'm sure it would work great for those with a boob job.  And as for the material, I thought it was nicely made.  I think its a pretty bra and definitely not cheaply made.  But also a bra I'd wash delicately.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought this bra, tried it on and found it to be very snug, but still wearable.  I decided to order another bra - same size, style, different color (tourmaline).  The second bra was much larger - the cups and the length of the band.  Both bras were labeled as ""small"", but obviously they are either extra-small and small / or /  small and medium.  I don't know which, since I have never purchased this brand before.  I expected such an expensive bra, made in Italy to be accurate, but I guess not.  I think someone sewed the wrong size label into one of the bras.  Otherwise, the fabric and stitching was very good quality.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The band of this Medium bra fits my 37"" Bcup fine on the widest setting, the straps are good, the cups are a bit overfull at the sides as there are no sides really. It certainly doesn't look like the photo in the ads. I plan to keep losing weight so it will fit better over time. It is very comfortable, looks pretty good, comes in excellent bright and dark colors, and washes just fine. I have 2 of these and will probably buy more in summer.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I needed a comfortable bra that I could place my inserts, as I had a double mastectomy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Probably my current favorite wire and padding free bra to date. I spent years looking for something comfy, flattering and not uber ugly. I can't believe I haven't purchased more than one! I am a 34B so if you're on the larger size I can't vouche for support, but for me it works.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought two of these in bright colors, since the colors are so much fun, and I like the idea of having less support sometimes.  However, after about 5 hours of wearing I just can't stand how tight it feels across the ribs and either wear it unfastened for a couple hours,( if I can get a away with that, or take it off all together).  I am a 32 C and bought a medium.  I ALWAYS  take an xs in all tops, so I don't think that sizing up will solve the problem.  Perhaps the problem is that it is not made in chest/cup sizes so that one can get a better fit.  I don't know. One reviewer said she thought that the band itself was the problem.  All I know is that I am not going to buy any more of them.  I bought the hot pink and the bright teal ones.  That part is fun.  The comfort (or lack of) is not.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Good looking

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great product. Im a 34C and bought Medium. Fits great.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not for me - too flimsy and absolutely no support in this bra. Disappointed.

  Please everyone thats considering purchasing.. Read all the 1 star reviews. This particular ""one size"" does not even fit most. When pulled out of packaging, looks like it would barey fit through my arm. I will post pix soon, but please beware, no returns once purchased. And with good reason too. Will definitely not look like model in their pictures. I would post a picture of the actual item on, but i know for sure it would get flagged. Shows absolutely everything. Definitely NOT recommended

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not true to size. This is a medium. I tried it on, it did stretch out, however, it rolled back up into a tube top. Im always a medium,, in everything I wear...I would need a 1X. Return was easy & refund was quick.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Um, this is supposed to fit my body? I would look like a Christmas ham all tied up in it! Know why? It's literally the size of a nightie for a baby dolly! Brings a whole new meaning to bodycon... My hubby saw it when I opened it and said, ""Is that for the cat?"" Yikes! Don't bother unless you have been in Sports Illustrated.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not as described.  Looks like it would fit a child's doll. Seller doesn't allow returns. It's a joke. Save your money ladies!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This thing comes in a little plastic bag that will fit in your pocket. There isn't much to it, but it's very stretchy and how it looks on you will depend on your size. Obviously the bigger you are the more it will open up. My wife is 5ft tall and 105 lbs. It doesn't need to stretch much to get on her and the openings in the mesh don't open up much but it still looks good on her.. Looks great with stockings of similar look. It's cheap so it's a good value for the price.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Really cute I could NOT believe it stretched over my size 14 body...I think my hubbie will love me in it...haven't worn it for him yet...but don't be afraid to buy its really cute and VERY stretchy

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Shoot, I actually really like and I would give it 5 starts but the way my chest was made... lol I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt think about it. I‚Äôm flat chested :( and that just made a big difference. The chest area kept slipping down so It‚Äôs just looked like a skirt on me haha. Wished it would‚Äôve stayed in place even though I don‚Äôt have breasts lol other than that it is very sexy and will stretch to your size!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This material is perfect for my body. I have stretch marks from having children and scars from 7 surgeries on my stomach. This material hides it all.

  I wanted to like this since it was so cute in the picture. I've never been able to wear ""full coverage"" bras since my girls are top shallow and bottom heavy (the cups always gap a lot at the top). I thought maybe a plunge bra would work, but sadly I was wrong. Overall quality of the bra was not bad for the price, it appeared well constructed. Unfortunately, the cups tapped a lot at the top for me. Also, the mesh makes this not fully adjustable and the straps fit me a little strangely. Might work out better for someone taller and with rounder girls.

  Hey Ladies!...So I don't like writing reviews but when I get great product I mean why not!! I have looking for a perfect Bra üòú and boy is it a mission!!.I'm so glad that I found this particular one!! I measured Myself just to make sure ! That I was still a 34DDD and I sure am lol . This bra is perfect I didn't want to take it off. About to order myself a few more !

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The literal moment I put this on, I actually yelled with excitement/relief. IT FITS. First of all, I hadnt had a properly fitted bra in months... so that could be part of it. üòÇ Regardless, this bra is really soft, supportive and sturdy. I love that it is barely lined (no pushup) and that the back strap is 3 hook wide. I feel immediate relief on my back and shoulders. I will probably get another one in black, I got the closest color to nude and it works really well for all my clothes so far. Huge sigh of relief. Highly recommend this bra, especially because it is low cost and its so hard to find my bra size (34DDD/E) under $40, let alone under $20. Very happy!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  What a perfect fit! I'm a 36ddd The back band is wide so it helps to to smooth out my back. The straps are very comfortable, the cup size is perfect no spillage.  I will be getting this in more colors.  I am so happy that a purchased this braüíï

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This product is a bit of a weird fit on me... i tried a lot of their products and I noticed that depending on the model I should either get a DD or a DDD. I have kept 2 models I liked but I wont keep this one.Here as you can see on the pictures the mesh is not attached to the bonnet  in addition the mesh is a little tighter because elastic so it makes this weird result of a too big bonnet that ends up not being flat under the mesh.I would recommend their only mesh bra. This one feels nice and no weird lining results.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This bra is very flattering! Next time I‚Äôm going to size down on the cup- I‚Äôm an in betweener, but usually find sizing up looks better so I don‚Äôt have muffin top tiddies. But this was a little gapped where the mesh meets the bra, and the way it‚Äôs cut I seriously doubt I‚Äôll get that muffin effect sizing down. The gapping wasn‚Äôt so noticeable that I sent it back, not even under sheer clingy tops. So EITHER way, if you‚Äôre in between cup sizes I think you‚Äôll still be pleased with your purchase. And it‚Äôs sexy without being trashy- which is important at my age, I‚Äôm almost 40- trashy is extra unflattering at my age.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought the last four of these bras that they had in my size (34-D.)  I had just had a procedure to remove a cyst from between my breasts and this looked like the center was low enough to not touch the incision as it healed. I was right. I wasn‚Äôt expecting such a good quality bra for the price I paid and was very pleased. When I went to have my stitches removed even the doctor said how cute she thought the bra was! The fit is true to size and it launders beautifully in a lingerie bag on a regular cycle. I always hang my bras to dry so I can‚Äôt state how it would hold up in the dryer, but it‚Äôs best to not put bras in the dryer anyway. It also is not itchy which is SO important in a bra. I will definitely be buying more in different colors.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this bra, it is gorgeous! The fit was a bit small, so ordered one band size up, and the fit is perfect, but then again, I ordered one band size down from what I had been wearing, because I am losing weight, so I would say the band sizing is a bit on the smaller size. The cup size was perfect, in both instances, which were a 36DDD and a 38DDD.Anyways...I loved it so much, I ordered a pink one too and also bought the matching stretch lace panties, which I love as well, and I also bought this brand's stretch lace black and pink bras which are comfy, and match the stretch lace panties as well!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bra fits well and seems to be size correct, but‚Ä¶.the cup puckers badly. The cups ripple and pucker from the cleavage outward‚Ä¶..looks very unattractive but I have discovered that with most tops, this isn‚Äôt noticeable. If you wore something plunging or more revealing it may‚Ä¶.but with most of my casual wear, you can‚Äôt see the rippling‚Ä¶ and it is comfortable and gives good support. Decided to keep it but can‚Äôt give it more than 3 stars due to the design flaw.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Tr√®s joli. J'ai achet√© dans le rose vif. J'aime la transparence et la forme du buste dans ce soutien gorge. J'ai malheureusement pris une taille trop petite mais l'ai recommand√© dans la bonne taille.  Si vous d√©sirez le confort supr√™me, ce n'est peut-√™tre pas le mod√®le qu'il vous faut mais si vous aimez un soutien gorge coquet qui fait bien, vous pouvez miser sur celui-ci!Je recommande.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This company knows how to make bras that look amazing and fit perfectly. I never imagined I could order a bra online that was perfect. Not to mention the quality and price.  Kudos to this company; I‚Äôm a fan!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This bra has to be the most comfortable bra I‚Äôve ever worn that has underwire. I got into wearing sports bras because I don‚Äôt like underwire. This bra is not only lovely looking, but I wear it and I can‚Äôt even tell I have a wire in there. Definitely am going to get another one. Fits perfectly!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The size fit perfectly, I think another reviewer noted that the cup and the mesh can leave a bit of a ripple effect due to the fabric differences but that doesn't bother me and it doesn't show through clothing. Overall I am satisfied with this purchase, its sewn well and doesn't dig in anywhere. Fits true to my size.

  I was really worried about the fit of these since I‚Äôm a size 16/18, but they worked perfectly! I would absolutely give 5 stars, but my only downside was that the waistband didn‚Äôt want to stay for me. The color was vibrant! If your thighs touch be aware the crystals get caught on each other and your legs end up stuck together.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  They're fun but not the most comfortable. The studs would snap against each other, some fell off and material a bit itchy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These are cute stockings. Fishnet,  have spandex in them I believe.  But the nude color is sort of weird- looking , at least on me.  ( I have pale skin).  I did order them in red and black but have not tried them on yet.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These tights are the worst quality you will see , as soon as I put them on they ripped and rhinestones fell off ..wish I never purchased to just throw away after.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The rhinestones in between the thighs got stuck together so it ripped the stockings in the inner thighs. But other than that, they are great and look amazing with any outfit your pair it with.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I waited forever for these to arrive. Tried them on- rhinestones popped off despite being super slow and careful putting them on. Tried to remove them and they tangled so much I can't fix it. So, they looked good, but are now trash. Don't bother, please.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The item seems small when you remove from package. But it Stretches out to your body. I‚Äôm serious. My husband went crazy when he seen me in these stocking. I love the diamonds Embedded on them

  Love this! I ordered a size small and it fits as expected. Very sexy!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I LOOOOOOVE IT! So cute and flattering. Perfect for shoots.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So I rarely write reviews, but felt compelled to write one expressing how amazing this item really is and how happy I am with my purchase. It‚Äôs simply beautiful! They details seem very high end and you would not be able to tell the cost. It is soft, elegant, true to size and darn SEXY! I am getting all the colors ‚ò∫Ô∏è!!Ps. I do think they run a litte small.  I am 5ft.4‚Äù and weigh 155 lbs. I also am very busty and always have trouble with things fitting appropriately. I would normally wear a large in tops, but I got the size XXL in this and it was perfect. Hope this helps!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I typically wear a M/L, based on previous reviews, I ordered an XXL as I wanted it to fit loosely and be slightly longer. Unfortunately, this robe didn‚Äôt even cover my backside it was so short. Also, it barely closed and was skin tight. The ribbon that came with it as a tie was silky so it wouldn‚Äôt stay tied at all. The material was lovely, however, and the only saving grace of this piece. I will likely never wear it as it‚Äôs so small/tight and not at all flattering.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love love love how this looks on!! It comes right down to the bottom of my cheeks, so it covers just enough. For reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 ft and 160Lbs.  Not a bad price for quality either, however I will note the cheapest part of the robe is the ribbon they provided for you to tie it closed with. But I‚Äôm not mad about it.  It‚Äôs still super cute!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this robe!! I get so many compliments on it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It's about what I expected for the price, not super high quality, but nothing wrong with it either. I'm 5'7"" and it barely covered my backside, but that's fine for what I'm using it for! It definitely has a lot less material than most robes width-wise, so if you're looking for something that only just crosses over in front, go with your usual size, but if you're looking for a more traditional fit, size up.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Pairs well with most of my undergarments. Just beautiful.

  Arrived at my house with stains everywhere including a literal BLOOD stain on the crotch. Do not buy. I am literally so grossed out

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The material is nice and it fits like a true small. It is hard to figure out how to put on but cute once it‚Äôs on. The bottoms are cheeky so if you‚Äôre not comfortable with that don‚Äôt get it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Definitely challenging to figure out at first. It's best just to detach all the pieces and start from scratch, but it's so sexy once on! Works for small chested girls too. I did notice the pink fits slightly better than the orange. I also ordered the leopard print and was not a fan of the print in person.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So so cute!!  hard to put on though! Worth it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The bottom is GINORMOUS!! LOL!! I could‚Äôve worn just the bottom as a bikini. But it ended up looking like what Borat wore to the beach in his movie. Im dying rolling on the floor laughing

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Dude what a cute bathing suit from the front! Then you turn around and the bikini bottom is literally halfway up my spine. I have a curvy hourglass figure, 150 pounds, 34DDD and everything (large) fit except for the back of the bottom. Returning. It‚Äôs that bad.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Cute bathing suit- a little hard to figure out how to put on at first, but can be tied and adjusted in a number of ways to best suit your preference.Sizing is super accurate.... I usually wear a medium in swimwear but sized up to large out of caution. Definitely could have went with my normal size!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super cute but should come with some instructions on how to put on lol!

  I‚Äôm a dude so these were for my fianc√© but they do fit great and look sexy as hell. Cosabella has always had a high standard when it comes to panties. Hell anything is better than granny panties nothing is a bigger turn off then seeing the those skin looking panties. These on the other hand are always a pleasure to see and apparently feel great.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Cosabella is worth the extra money every time. The mesh is so comfortable it's like not wearing anything at all. And they last longer than On Gossamer and every other brand that I've purchased. The mesh and elastic are unsurpassed in both quality and design. And the fit is invisible through even the sheerest of dresses. Honestly the best panty I've ever purchased and my go to brand for many years now.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  SO CUTE. i love it!!! flattering and flirty

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Look, feel, n fit great

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Lightweight and comfortable but too expensive. Got a similar product several years ago in a PX for a lot less, wish I had kept the tags.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love the panties. But the material they were made out of, I was expecting softer material. I love that they are transparent panties.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is my go to thong. This is all I ever purchase.  They are so comfy, luxury at its best. Worth every $$. They are extremely durable. Forget hanky panky, its all about that Cosabella!!! I luv luv luv these.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love Cosabella soire - and I'm really happy that this thong matches the bra perfectly (though, I confess - I thought the color was more grape jelly than cranberry jelly).  Fits nicely.

  I was going to do a good test drive on these before writing a review.  I've bought different versions of the same type of thing a couple times before (name brands) and they would either ride up, the seam would bother me or the crotch would hang.  I LOVE these things.  I gave them over 2 weeks, washed them, wore them the whole day doing a lot of walking, wore them under skirts.  I wasn't doing this to write a good review, I was looking for flaws as I'm going out of the country and can't afford to take something bad with no place to get replacements like other brands if these didn't work.  I am a happy camper.  I have gotten 3 sets so far  I actually also wear them around the house when it's hot.  I don't get paid to write reviews or get any products.  I don't have time for that and I wouldn't sell my integrity anyway.  But other women need to know that these are awesome.  I have no idea where they are made but keep them coming.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 170lbs, wear size 10/12 jeans and purchased size L.While I certainly wouldn‚Äôt consider these ‚Äúsexy basics,‚Äù they are super comfy and don‚Äôt squeeze your legs or tummy like other shapewear does. They stayed in place running around work today, and were still comfortable after a big dinner.I plan to wear them under dresses, as they are short enough to hide under most office-length dresses/skirts and they seem to breathe well. There‚Äôs a crotch flappy thing sewn to the front/back/sides of a diamond shape, attached with a few stiches to teatyer it in place, with a soft side facing skin‚Äî not quite as lined as typical underwear, more like something found on cheap bikini bottoms. But I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd wear anything else with them if wearing as dress bloomers. The light color is noticeably less flattering than the black ones, but I like that they don‚Äôt ride up and none of them created the ever dreaded ‚Äúcamel toe.‚Äù

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This product almost makes me mad it's so comfortable-- the cut, the material, the sizing. I'm mad because I spent 28 years of my life wearing wedgie/saggy/itchy/bad underwear and only discovered this recently.It's the patriarchy, I tell you. Trying to make you think your butt needs to look cute under your clothes at all times. IT DOES NOT. Your butt needs to be COMFORTABLE under your clothes at all times.Let your butt be comfortable. Buy this underwear.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is just the type of short I was looking for. It is the perfect length, super comfy and the feel is amazing!!!! I bought it to wear with oversized tees/sweaters. I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù and weigh 160 and bought size medium and they fit perfect! Like a glove

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I received this package some time ago. Haven't written because I was waiting to use them first. I bought these to use under dresses and tunics, to help prevent sweating and the all hated hub rub!The feel of the material is super soft and slips on smoothly! Great start. As the day goes on I have noticed that I haven't had to fuss with them at all. Super comfy and stay in place!  The same was true for all 3. The same fit and quality for each.You can't go wrong with these shorts! I highly recommend them and will buy more from this seller again. Thanks for your time and hope I helped someone.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These are bike shorts not panties. They do not ride up the leg while walking, bending ECT. They are not see through. Colors are loud, but not a turn off. They are very soft to the touch. No itchy tag to deal with bothering you. I have only washed them once so far, so I have no idea how they hold up.Would I recommend these bike shorts. At this time yes.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Like a second skin!  Very soft, comfortable fit.  No twisting, binding or rolling up.  Smooth under clothing.  Double panel at crotch.  These are underwear.  I would not wear them for outerwear.  Turn inside out, cold gentle wash.  Hang to dry or low gentle cycle in dryer.  I am 5'8"" tall and weigh 165 lbs.  Bought XL.  I have ordered three packages total as I like these a lot!  Will order again.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So I ordered a size bigger because everyone was saying they were somewhat small and order bigger and I wish I had ordered my regular size because I won‚Äôt get to wear these long since I did order them bigger. I‚Äôve been on a diet and exercise regiment and am loosing weight. But I got to say..I will never buy another brand if I can help it ever again! These are so comfortable! I‚Äôll be back in a few weeks for another set!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It's lovely to have some colours other than white, black and skin to be honest so for me it was well worth it for the brown and grey... they go perfectly with some little linen summer dresses I have which means chub rub is sorted in the heat and no need to worry about the wind exposing parts you want kept to yourself! They are comfortable and smooth on the skin so I would recommend them.  I have just bought another set I like them so much!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Work perfectly for what I bought them for - to wear under skirts to stop the chafe!  Lovely soft material. In my opinion not suitable to wear as a pair of shorts on their own - too thin for this.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Well, these are some BIG PANTS. I hoped it will not come to that but I reached this age now. Being on the large side, had to resort to wearing leggings in summer as my thighs were rubbing in the heat. With these, as non-sexy as they are - I finally regained my summer wardrobe. They are super soft and wash very well. I have never been so excited about a piece of ‚Äòold lady underwear‚Äô.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not as described, Way to small. My size 12 daughter in law says that they help stop her thighs from chafing and are comfortable. HOWEVER that's not great for a size 20/22. Disappointed is an understatement. Can't recommend.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Much better quality than expected and genuinely very lovely and soft. Bought to wear under dresses for work in the summer months to make sitting more comfortable, and they are perfect for this. Gusseted too which I wasn't expecting. I wear size 10-12 and bought small, which is fine for wearing underneath a dress but probably too tight if wearing as shorts.

  I love it! My husband couldn‚Äôt keep his hands off and I feel sooooooo sexy!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is a soft and stretchy beautiful piece! It comes with  thong panties. I bought a XXL. I'm 5'6. 220lbs, size 14, 38DDD. I need support so the pictures are taken with my black plunge bra.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm putting it all out there! I'm 5'10, 250 lbs. I usually wear an 18/20. I ordered this in a 3X. It fit, but it was SKIN tight and a little short on me, it kept riding up. However, I did find it to be very beautiful and flattering. I gave this 4 stars simply because I wish it was just a little longer, but overall I was happy with my purchase.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great product that looks amazing while still somehow fitting comfortably!I was searching for maternity lingerie to wear in my 3rd trimester but everything I came across just looked super matronly. Pre-pregnancy I normally wear a large in these sorts of items (for reference I'm 5'3"" and 160-170# and wear a size 10/12 dress and 38D bra) so figured an XL would give me enough stretch to cover my growing belly & chest.This worked perfectly and as soon as I put it on I felt confident and sexy. The material is stretchy yet flattering in all the right ways. My husband loves it too. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for plus size or maternity lingerie!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Never thought about buying lingerie on here but I decided to try. I am 5'7, 250lbs & a 40DD bust size & I ordered an 2XL. I love this. Great fit, makes me feel sensual & looks sexy on my skin.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm a bigger gal with a ""sturdy"" frame (think German stock) so finding lingerie that actually looks halfway decent on is a major feat.  This little number did it and I was pleasantly surprised!  I'd go by your measurements when selecting a size, but it is stretchy so it is very forgiving.  Excellent buy - and especially for the price.  Hoping my new hubby will appreciate!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Careful when you wash it.I bought this outfit based off the reviews. I had low expectation.  Being a plus size (5,7‚Äô | 250 | 38F) woman with large breast, it‚Äôs extremely hard to find tops that fit properly.I also knew that the panties that came with it would not meet me comfort level.The outfit arrived and I love it!  I swapped out the panties with tummy control thongs.  Wow!! I feel soo comfortable and sooo damn sexy at the same time! It‚Äôs keeps my girls in and isn‚Äôt too big or small.  The material hugs your body and keeps you feeling secure.  I jumped around and shakes my boobs and they didn‚Äôt fall out.  Material is soft and stretchyBe careful when you wash it.  Follow the directions.  The panties accidentally got washed and dried with all my jeans. Panties are all frayed now. üôÅ

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This product came on time. I was pleasantly surprised when it actually fit! Usually with these types of things my boobs don‚Äôt fit in them right, and spill under or over where they‚Äôre supposed to go. I am 5‚Äô7 38d and have a thick body, wide hips. I ordered an xxxl. The boob area was very slightly loose but not overly so. Everywhere else fit perfectly, and I didn‚Äôt have to struggle to get it on. The thing is quite short though it‚Äôs supposed to be- was perfectly stretchy -material is a little itchy but it looked great and my bf loved it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Let me tell you every woman needs this little number !! Wow the fit it amazing, it feels nice on the skin and husband really really loves it! It hugs your curves so well! Sexy and definitely worth purchase !

  I was excited it for my top because I have big boobs and it‚Äôs normally a problem when I order online. Even with 36 DDD‚Äôs it fit as desired. Definitely plan on buying more colors.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 6‚Äù0 290 pounds I brought a 2X and they fit comfortably I just wish I could tighten up the bra more but it was sexy I felt confident and my husband loved it! Buy it!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super comfy, stretchy and flattering! Will buy in more colors!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I give this product 5 stars. I loved the bottoms and how high waisted they are. They hid my little tummy stretch marks and were very comfortable!As for the bra, it gives no support especially for my mom boobs so I had to go to T A R G E T and get an underwire lacy bra.I‚Äôm okay with the bra being a waste only because I loved the bottoms since it‚Äôs hard to find anything as high waisted.A large fit me perfect! 5‚Äô3, 145 lbs., size 9/10

  ¬†I love this set its sexy and affordable

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'll start by saying the bottoms look fine and if the set hadn't been $33 I might have kept it just for the underwear.The top, however....was simultaneously too large and too small. I ordered the 3x assuming I'd need to size up as is often the case with online orders. I found the strap portions of the top to be too large. In order for them to be tight enough to actually provide any ""support"" of sorts, I would have probably needed to go down to a 1x. That said, the ""cup"" part (well...boob covers, not cups at all) barely covered a 3rd of each boob, right down the middle. I'm a DD....A size you'd typically expect a 3x of anything to provide sufficient coverage on. Not so. - So...unless you've got fakes that stand up on their own and look decent no matter what you drape them with, this will just look like a couple pieces of saggy lace hanging off your front.

  It‚Äôs cute on . I‚Äôm considered to be plus size and heavy top , it was cute to wear for that night lol

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am a plus size girl, xl-1xl .  . . And it fits!!!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was skeptical because of my body proportions. But the top and bottom did me justice I bought an XL and I was impressed. It gave me full confidence. I might just wear it for fun. The material dosen't feel cheap and I washed it and air dryed it and it looks the same. My olny downside is where the PLEASE is on the panties is a bit low. You have to raise up the underwear much higher to read it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I tried this on as soon as I got it. The top had straps that were too long and it sat so low my boobs kept poppping out. The bottoms were also cut a bit weird for my body. These may work for a thinner or athletic body, but curves are a no go. It‚Äôs hard to have some fun role play if the cute outfit won‚Äôt contain some of your best assets.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits very baggy even after washing and drying it. The top is super loose and the bottom is like huge granny panties. Not flattering at all.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm a 32DD and ALWAYS wear a medium. However this set is HUGE. Be sure to size down. I‚Äôm going to have to get this altered or SOMETHING.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bottoms aren‚Äôt cute at all but the top is cute. I honestly couve sized down bc the top is a little big so the straps hang long

  No, you don't get to see a picture of my wife wearing this lingerie, but take my word for it, this is well worth the money. It's sexy without being slutty (well, maybe a little slutty), it looks great, feels great, and is easily removed either slowly or in somewhat of a rush. Do yourself (or your husband) a favor and pick one up today. Actually, for the price, get 2, you can never go wrong with more. :-)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The material is very soft and comfy and both pieces are very cute. It's ties in the front between the breasts, which I didn't notice before ordering but it's fine. My only complaint is that it leaves a large empty gap between my breasts that makes my chest look flatter. I'm going to do some sewing to adjust, since I can't simply grow larger breasts to fill in the cups and pull it closer lol. Overall though, very nice

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not the most flattering when you have somewhat of a pooch belly. I purchased this thinking it was kind of a peekaboo belly and instead my whole stomach was exposed. Great material though beautiful color. I ended up gifting it to my sister she loves it it fits her perfectly.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My husband loved this on me, there wasn't a ton of support for your chest but its not like it was on very long. Super cute.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bought of a girlfriend. But didn't have a chance to give it to her. So not sure how they fit. Are look on her. But the price is ok. Maybe I will find a girlfriend to give it to some day.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I purchased a XXL. The color is very nice and vibrant but it‚Äôs definitely not like advertised. When tied shut it still shows my stomach and doesn‚Äôt really hug the girls like advertised. While I can make this piece work for me, I feel like this piece is more for women with perky breast.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This item has lots of pretty colors to choose from.  I have a couple of them.  This item fits well and is very sexy.  Not only is it hot!, it is very comfortable to wear.

  Comfortable.  Actually very pretty

  Very soft material, which I thought contained some spandex, but it does not. I am heavy on the top - this night gown would have been GREAT if It contained cups for support - it is too loose on top, letting my breast hand slightly :( I purchased an XLarge, but probably could have gotten away with a Large. But I do not think the Large would have solved the issue with my breast. I have decided not to re-purchase, but to search for a nightgown with spandex so it hugs alittle more on my body.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  FITS AND FEELS AMAZING. Super soft and very comfortable to sleep in.. but beware if you have nipple piercings and your boobs fall out over night, it does get caught.

  I'm 5ft 1, 200lb i bout a 2x and it was form fittingso it runs small, i was hoping for a little looser fitlooked really nice, very soft fabric

  This is the softest nightgown! I am a ‚Äúhot sleeper‚Äù and this modal fabric is perfect- feels like you‚Äôre wearing almost nothing! Lace is not itchy at all (something I have found in other similar items), and it washes well too! It is a little more form fitting than I had expected but so comfortable it‚Äôs ok! Would highly recommend!!

  This product is very comfortable, good quality, and true to size.I'm 5'6 and between 145 and150 lbs. I ordered a large because I wanted a roomy fit, which is what I got. A medium would actually fit more appropriately, but I like the extra room.That being said, I ordered 6 in black, and hope to order more, which will probably include some mediums.

  I wanted to do a boudoir photo session for my hubby so I thought you'd would be cute! I'm 5'4 and 200pds and normally a large in everything but I thought I'd go up a size and now I wish I would've gone up another size. My boobs won't fall out of the sides but they do pop out a bit. The shorts fit as well but they are just a bit tight and ride up. The robe is nice and fits too but it doesn't have belt loops as stated in other reviews.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very cute set! I'm 5'5, 198lbs, size large. Shorts are pretty snug, like zero breathing room lol. The bralette fits perfectly. Love the robe, came with a tie but the ribe doesn't have any loops for the tie... that was disappointing.Very soft, silk like material, this green is beautiful! Will purchase again but a size larger than normal.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  In this set there are so many pieces you get your money's worth. The color was perfect for my skin tone and all the accessories were cute. The satin is thin and soft but doesn't collect static as you wear it. It has a silky texture on the skin and the lace and elastic trims are soft and comfortable. The bralet has adjustable straps and the piece along with the underwear has a lot of stretch. I ordered a size small and it was a little big, but not too bad. The underwear has no panty lining.... and the robe has no belt loops but other than that it was a fantastic buy. The shorts are high waisted and cheeky style. The fabric can be easily ironed on low setting. Fabric for shorts and robe are 90% Polyester and 10% Spandex. All edges are rolled hems finished with surging. You can machine wash it, but I suggest a gentle hand washing and hang drying. Made in China. Pretty good quality for a low price. I'll most likely order a few more in different colors!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was surprised how much I liked this! I didn‚Äôt expect much for the quality, but it‚Äôs silky and soft and sooo cute. It‚Äôs nice to lounge around in. The lace top fit me well, bottoms too (I ordered medium). The only minor complaint would be the odd bulge that the shorts tend to create at the front when your body is in a certain pose... it can look I guess a little unappealing for photos. But that‚Äôs about it, all else I love about this set!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Okay it‚Äôs cuteHowever everything fit except the shorts.Which I find interesting.The shorts are way too small they are like a size x-large I couldn‚Äôt get them to my knees and everything else I bought same size fits perfectly fine.They definitely did not size the shorts correctly I‚Äôm sad because this was for my bday gathering and I can‚Äôt even wear the shorts.Huge disappointment.If you are full figured I recommend going a couple sizes up because I went one size up and still the shorts only is entirely to small.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Item looks just like the picture. I ordered a small but it is still EXTREMELY too big! Ladies if your petite I‚Äôd advise you to gain weight or not order product lol. Other than the product being overly too big, it is perfect

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Definitely glad I read the reviews. You definitely want to size up or 2. I‚Äôm a large at 5‚Äô7 and 180lbs and the xxl fit perfect. Top is completely sheet but everything fit perfectly. Beautiful material. I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments. Love lounging around the house in this

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super pretty color and the medium fit perfect (: Robe is a little funny and the top is just a piece of lace with straps. Expected quality for only $23üëçüèª

  I honestly thought it was going to be too big on the bust part due to the fact I have no breast but the fit was amazing (I got a small btw ;))

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'5, about 155 lb, 34B bra, with an hourglass/ athletic shape.I'm not comfortable to share a photo, but it looks so good that I could!The top fits perfect Medium for a 34B! I like that the straps sit wide and hide my armpit pudge.The bottoms are a little small, but very sexy. They're not tight, just less fabric... I have a huge butt and big thighs, so I was satisfied that the bottoms don't cut into my hips or give me ""muffin top"" at all. But yeah, they're teeny-tiny/ low rise.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Absolutely love this set! Looks great if you have a small chest (like me!). I read several reviews from Shein, Romwe and on Amazon before ordering to figure out what size to get. I‚Äôm usually a small for tops and a med/lg for bottoms (135lbs). The large fit me perfectly! I do have A cups so I don‚Äôt quite fill out the bra, but if it was any smaller it wouldn‚Äôt be able to strap around my chest comfortably. Overall, with the straps loosened all the way, it looks gorgeous. Love love love it. Cannot wait to show this to my boyfriend for V-day!EDIT: Strap in the front snapped when I tried it on for V-Day and Amazon REFUSES to  exchange it. Amazon is also demanding the broken set be returned to them, even though they apparently cannot exchange it since it was sold through a different seller. Honestly this is Amazon‚Äôs fault more than Shein‚Äôs, go ahead and purchase through shein.com and not here in case you have any issues!

  Me encanta como me queda el conjunto, la talla es exactamente c√≥mo lo indica.El material es muy c√≥modo y muy sexy para una ocasi√≥n especial.La tela es de buena calidad, creo que compar√© en otros colores :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I wanted a basic sexy set so this was exactly what i needed! I am between a medium and large so I ordered both. I found that both fit well for my body type. (The medium is without fishnets and the one with the fishnets is a large)  I obviously feel more comfortable in the large since i have a bit of a wiggle room with the adjustable straps but also with the large I am at the most tightest length. The medium looks good as well! buuut what I did find was that the size large panties fit WAY better than the medium (it just doesn't cover my majora/mound as much) and the chest in medium fits WAY better than the large. SO if you are like me, i would honestly just recommend the medium since its tight and you can adjust the bra. (and maybe pair it with some other cute panties)  ALSO don't speak for all! always measure yourself before!!This might have been a confusing insight, but overall it is such a cute set that I know ill shrink into. and they pair well with fishnets! (also on amazon)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am have a classic hour-glass figure. I purchased a small, the bottom fits well, but the top is WAY TOO SMALL. Plus, there is no way to adjust anything on either piece. I am keeping the set because it‚Äôs not worth the trouble to return it, and I can still wear the bottom. All in all, not worth the money in my opinion. I could just purchase a pair of bottom like this for less.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered this in red as well as black. They both fit great.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs cute but if I move my arms up the top looks weird. Just doesn‚Äôt stay in place well because of the way the band is set up. It‚Äôs also a little too big but I‚Äôm small so

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  SO CUTE! I'm quite petite and find lingerie usually looks baggy and is hard to feel confident in but this fits me so well! I'm 5'4 and weigh about 110 pounds. it runs small, I got an s but usually wear xs and there's no extra baggage room anywhere. super cute for an intimate night.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Items are not the same as pictured. I bought the white in medium. It is absolutely hideous in person. The fit is terrible. There‚Äôs zero quality to this item and it boggles my mind as to how this set has such high ratings.I‚Äôm a 34DD.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Lo compr√© para mi novia y le gust√≥ y a mi me encant√≥.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Took a long time to ship:/// my tibbies would out the bottom some times. Not super comfortable

  The set is fabulous and true to size. Loving the fit and color.

  This teddy exceeded my expectations so much that I just placed an order for another one. A while ago I purchased some lingerie from Amazon and the sizes were Asin and did not fit. So... I ordered this black teddy a size larger (XL... just in case) and it is too big. I will exchange that one. I am 5'5"", 157 pounds and wear a 38C. I'm approximately a size 12 and sometimes a 10 depending on brand. Just tidbits to help the next purchaser with sizing! The order I placed today is for a size L.This material is soft and luxurious! It is not stiff and scratchy. I'm hooked and will be back for more! The best thing is that I felt really sexy and my guy told me several times how sexy I looked... that was the plan! üòâ Can't wait to see his reaction when I'm wearing the red one!

  It's cute! Not the best for busty ladies though. I'm 5'8, 150lbs, and a 36ddd and it fit great everywhere but the boobs

  ¬†I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù 140 lbs and have small boobs and ordered a medium and I would honestly exchange it for a small. The adjustable neckline makes it super versatile size wise so base it much more on your boob/width rather than ur height. Very soft and can kind of see nipple but not super obvious.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This fits perfect! I bought the XL, I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù and am 185 pounds. I wear Lg so you do need a size up from your normal size. The whole size thing always worries me even with reviews as they usually don‚Äôt say what size they bought. The tie around the neck helps to get the length you need in all the right areas. It looks great on! It is soft to the touch and feels nice on. I just purchased this in white also!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I tired it on first and it looked awful. Then the wife tried it on... SO MUCH BETTER! Looks great and easy access. The aftermath shows up well on the black.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love the colour but the top feels on the large size/too long.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Material is good, but I returned it back. It‚Äôs too big

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very sexy . Fits well , although I went a size up. Material is decent quality and does stretch.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very sexy, lace is pretty and nice and soft. It actually helps my shape. I was worried about my tummy area but the way its cut is flattering. The material is amazing, not thin don't think it will rip very easily. My husband had no complaints.

  My wife got this for my birthday and it was the best 37 seconds of 2020!

  DO NOT ORDER if you have a long torso. I'm 5'8"" and this was going straight up every crack and crevice. Maybe if you are short you won't have this problem. But to halter it around your neck the way it's supposed to, then snap the closures with a longer torso, expect it to go everywhere you don't want it to. Not sexy and defiantly not comfortable. Usually I'm better at reading reviews before ordering things, but I rushed it because of valentines day. I ordered the correct size (medium) I wasnt going to order a large because I have a small chest. Had this been longer, it would have fit perfect.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I found this to be quite nice! Bought as a gift to myself, fit snug, comfortable and very enticing! Even though I was alone..lol...I will admit, it took a minute or two to figures out the neck choker..I almost mistook it for straps! Lmbo..I can't say I flatter this garment very well, but as a work in progress, the sex drip is on the way! I would recommend this to everyone...I am 5""3, 138 lbs approx..and this was a small.Make it work for you ladies!! ü§ó

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am not sure how to write this review for this product. I ordered an XL. I am 195 pounds, 46"" hip and 38 C chest, thick thighs & hips.. with some extras ;) I LOVE the look and style of this teddy. This was my first one, but this style was extremely short in the torso when it comes up and around your neck. I read in some reviews this happened to them as well, but I didn't think it would be a problem since I am short. I was definitely wrong. The high-waisted hip cut detail on the sides is super high, in my opinion... but I received a lot of compliments on this. Very sexy all together. GREAT cut and detail on the butt area, really flattering I think. This alone, I gave 2 stars off rip. Tried to get in red but, boy that color is popular! Black was the ticket!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This was the 1st time I bought lingerie in years & honestly, I was prepared to just throw it out if it didn't work for me. To my surprise, it actually fit great! (For reference, I'm 5'1"", 125lbs, 36-30-40 & bought a M.) The waist line is very flattering, it wasn't itchy, & the lace was more durable than I anticipated (with other lace, I've had it rip as I put it on). The red is more of a bright red than dark red or maroon, just fyi. Personally, I could've used a little push up in the top, but was able to make it work with a sticky bra - I just stitched the top about a half inch up to conceal the bra. Overall, especially considering the price, I was very happy with it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super cute, I reordered after getting an XL that was too small. The XXL is great, except it came ripped already...

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I really wanted this to work! I ordered the purple‚Äîcolor was rich and beautiful, the lace was soft. But for me, it just isn‚Äôt long enough for my torso. I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù 180-185 lbs. I tried an XL and an XXL. The larger size was roomier in the waist but not any longer. I must just have a weirdly long torso because I can see from the reviews it fit other ladies with my height & weight. I think it‚Äôs really cute for the price if it works for you!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The lace seems very good quality and is soft and comfortable to wear. I was nervous to buy lingerie online but I'm glad I did! I'm 5'4"" 145lbs and 36B and the small fits me well.

  I ordered both a large and a medium as I wasn‚Äôt sure how they were going to fit. I ended up liking the fit of the medium much better; however, the medium arrived damaged. Right between the breast the stitching had come undone. I ended up sending it back and the replacement arrived in perfect condition. The material is very soft and flows. The color is true to the pictures.34D with 30‚Äù waist for reference

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Perfect fit

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I like to wear cute comfy night gowns. This one is my new favorite. It came earlier than expected,  excellent condition,  and great quality.  It came with a matching thong. The breast area is not push up it is lined with lace,  but there is a seam underneath your breast and the straps are adjustable so it is flattering.  I bought the small.  I am 5'6"" Victoria secret 32C and about 135lbs. I love the red color and the fabric is veryyyy soft!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bought this set for a boudoir shoot. It was honestly the best decision.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 around 110 pounds.  It‚Äôs sexy and comfortable.  I really like the detail on the back!  Soft, stretchy material is very cling and shows the outline of everything (panties, hipbones).

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fit as expected, go up one side.  I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù195 lbs usually a size 14 ordered a XL. Good quality, fast shipping, totally worth it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Came a bit wrinkled (which I expected), but AMAZING! it's comfortable and sexy, the light, flexible material clings to your body in all the right ways!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Loved, perfect for some boudoir pictures!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is a nice piece! My hubby liked it on me. I got navy blue very soft fabric. Adjustable straps help keep the girls in but not totally secure enough for sleeping. Good buy for the price washes well

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs a smaller fit to other styles

  This was a hit. If you are not the ""sexy lacey lady"" type this is the piece for you. I bought this in grey, XL. I'm 5'7 around 180lb. This item falls just right. It wasn't tight so I felt comfy but still got the desired attention. You may even want to go a size down for a closer fit. The material is tshirt soft. You will forget you're wearing lingerie...but your SO will not.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is my second of these chemists and I absolutely love them - I want one in every color! They are super cute & sexy, flattering, and incredibly soft & comfortable all at the same time! I love the adjustable straps (I have a slight scoliosis so one of my shoulders sits a bit lower than the other) and the short length - I'm only 5"" tall and it's really hard finding nightgowns that don't come down to my knees. I bought a small and it's definitely true to size. I will definitely be buying more from this brand!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I loved this night gown. It was sexy, yet very comfy. It is super soft as well. I'm 5'1 175 ps and I ordered a large due to my breast size, and it fits great. I probably could have sized down though. I love the adjustable straps and the way that is flows. I'll definitely be ordering more of these.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very soft and sexy. What a win... sexy nighties are never comfortable. Love the green color! I normally wear a medium, but followed advice on other reviews and purchased a large... it could be a bit smaller, but I see how a medium may have been too small. I‚Äôm happy with the large fit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It looks better then I expected feels so soft and comfy when wearing it. Its prime so shipping came fast. I'm plus size an normally wear size 14 pants or 1x I ordered extra large hoping it would fit right and its perfect. It doesn't have cups for your chest area which is what I was looking for because I'm extremely top heavy and cups make me fall out. I just ordered two other colors dark grey and dark green cant wait for them to come. Will be wearing these alot to bed üòä

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I used to sleep in tanks or tees, I‚Äôd rather sleep in this every night, it‚Äôs so comfortable! So flattering, and so soft! I want 10 more!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was looking for some comfortable nightgowns that were super soft and I had no idea what material that was. I took a risk but I LOVE THESE. I got the black and the red, they are the slinky type of material that hugs your curves but is not tight at all, it is super comfy. The straps are fully adjustable which is a plus for girls like me with a short torso. I am also very slim, 34-24-36 and it fit me nicely, not in the waist of course, a bit big but overall looks great and feels great I am super satisfied.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I almost bought a medium because that's my normal size but I'm so glad I sized up. This little number is super short! But made me feel super feminine and sexy! My husband loved it (this is his account lol). For reference I'm 5'7"", 145lbs and tall/athletic build. The straps are adjustable which I really liked too.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Nice fit, nice look and nice feel to fabric, but lace strap has already come away on the back and only worn 5 times.  I will need to re attach to be able to wear again.  I imagine this might be a problem with this style

  I LOVE IT !! I got an xl because I was afraid it wouldn‚Äôt fit but i could of gotten an L and it would of fit even better.I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 215lb and 40D in bra and this fit great but loose, glad it has adjustable straps.I also wanna say it had more good reviews than bad but all the bad ones said the same thing about the strap snapping off so when I got it I pulled on all the straps before trying it on and they all held up so idk.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Quality item! The fit is amazing...I‚Äôm a curvier woman and I was concerned about the fit for the bottom and when I tried it on I had no issues! Would definitely suggest purchasing it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This body suit is amazing. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and 140lbs and this medium fit pretty well (it‚Äôs a little long in the torso) and I honestly was considering returning for a small. I‚Äôm just going to keep the medium but it‚Äôs super stretchy and comfy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  5‚Äô10‚Äù / 150lbs / ordered a largeSoft, delicate, and cute! Runs a bit big in the chest (I‚Äôm a 36c) so I‚Äôm going to try sizing down to the medium. Couldn‚Äôt be worn with a bra but could use bathing suit pads in the top for more lining or support. The bottom part is all black and comes up pretty high ‚Äî would need really high waisted bottoms so it doesn‚Äôt show. Also the snap closures are large plastic and really easy to close, which will be nice if it‚Äôs ever safe to drink in bars again lol

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ADORE this item. I wasn‚Äôt sure at first. Looking for something similar to Thistle & Spire... fits amazing. Not tight/not loose. I‚Äôm a 36DD and got a large. The fabric is great quality (more desirable over most VS ‚Äúlingeries‚Äù) and it can be worn under a cardigan and with some high waist pants. The cups are not see through. I would buy this again and probably will purchase other colors if avail. HIGHLY recommend.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This was exactly how it looked in the picture. I was worried about the fit because of my boobs but a medium fit it perfectly. Loved this product will be buying the white one soon!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Honey hurry up and get it! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô71/4 üòú. I weight 215 a size L or Xl to be comfortable. First brought this to wear underneath my anniversary dress. As a little tease!  But plans changed so the slammin red dress was no longer appropriate and we were celebrating our anniversary with out best friends. So I‚Äôm always respectful and dressconservative when we‚Äôre around other couples. Baby I never felt so good and when he saw me walk out our restroom. He damn near ripped this remarkable lingerie. I‚Äôm 39. 40 is welcoming if I can feel like this all day! I‚Äôd take it! I‚Äôm buying more! You‚Äôre welcome! My husband said just wear this from now on underneath your clothes. üíãüíãüíã

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Upon receiving it, the seems were all messed up. lines were even, extra fabric wasnt cut off, and the straps located in the front of the piece (criss-cross straps) easily came undone as there was only two stitches holding it together . Where the clips are in the crouch, there was an extra thick, prickly fabric that i had to cut to make even so it wasnt pricking at my skin! I restitched all of the criss-cross straps as some were completely detached and others would easily detached with even the slightly pull.I kept it because i loved the design but upon wearing it the first time months after buying it i realized how wrong i was to keep it. The very first time wearing it the clips in the crotch area came completely undone. The thing basically came all undone!CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP PRODUCT!!!!DONT BUY! Unless you want to remake it!Cut design but that is literally all! Not worth the money and if i can go back to the day i received it, i should of shoved it back in the back and printed a return label.ONE AND DONE LINGERIE PIECE .... actually it would of never made it to the first and only wear if it wasnt for me adding stitches. TERRIBLE PRODUCT!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I absolutely love this, the colour is amazing on & the fit is beautiful üòç very sexy, would buy again.

  I‚Äôve been really wanting a harness but I have a very short torso because I‚Äôm only 4‚Äô11‚Äù and I was worried they wouldn‚Äôt fit me. They‚Äôre often adjustable width but then I‚Äôm too short. This one fit perfectly! I‚Äôm a 34B and 115 lbs and my waist is 28‚Äù. The waist strap fit on the smallest hole so if you‚Äôre thinner than a 28 you‚Äôll need to make new holes. But the shoulder straps actually had two holes left so it‚Äôd work for someone even shorter than me.I kinda took a chance on this one since it only had 25 reviews when I bought it but I‚Äôm really happy with it, doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôll break. It‚Äôs still pleather but it looks nice. So yes, confirmed, if you are petite this will fit!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  SUPER cute and well made for the price, but you can barely squeeze your girls into it if you're bigger than a B. I'm a D cup and it was tighter than what a hardness should be. Really bummed out because I love the shape and quality, wish they had adjusters or buckles in the cup region.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits perfectly. Will be great over dresses and tops.All of the pieces were evenly measured and cut during production, so it fit very well.Has MANY pre-cut holes to adjust it for a wide range of sizes. Love that the material is able to be cut with simple scissors, no leather tools required. I trimmed some of the excess straps so that the ends don't stick out and flop around. You would never know I did it at home. The ends won't fray if you cut 'em down to your size, and i love that, too!It doesn't look like leather -- if that's what you're looking for, the best bet is to buy genuine leather. But! It doesn't look like cheap plastic either. In fact it's soft amd pliable, and won't stiffen up; very comfortable. All in all it's great material if you want a vegan option, and you'll be very happy with it. Highly recommend.For reference, I'm a 36A and a 30 waist. This could be sized down a bit and sized up a lot more. As far as sizing goes it may not fit a DD, but that may depend on your frame.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  If you have a larger bust, do not waste you time or money with this harness. Inaccurate product description states this harness ""approximately fits 34.6 to"" (the inconsistent) ""size 41.7 / 43.7. One size fits most."" At the most, it will fit anyone with a bust no larger than 36"", with an A-C cup bra size. You are SOL, otherwise.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I like the quality of the product for the price, it makes me look reeeeaaally good. I am small and my chest is as well. It really gives me a nice lift and is very firm fitting and it wasn‚Äôt too loose or anything. I do think that people with bigger goods will have an issue with this being restrictive and not very adjustable. It is good for the price but I would recommend looking at other reviews if you have larger boobs and possibly being prepared to return it. Overall I like it but I do wish it was more inclusive. Also, it is nice because I find it hard to find a good waist to chest ratio for these items and it was a good fit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I got this for a Halloween costume that didn't work out so I improvised and this item was great! I usually have a hard time with things with straps because I'm more petite (5'1"" and 110lbs) but this adjusted for me perfectly fine! it looked great on and was super comfortable.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This won‚Äôt fit if you have big boobs at all. The quality is a little cheap but not super bad. I had to had a belt from another harness to make this adjustable for my chest. I wouldn‚Äôt buy again. I‚Äôm a summary it I had to work with it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It's a little tricky to put on, but it is very adjustable and should fit every size. I'm a bust size 34 E and didn't have any problems fitting it around my chest. I got a lot of compliments the first time I wore it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Looks great fits perfect

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô 6‚Äù155lbs and got a large it fits perfectly!! I can‚Äôt wait to surprise my husbamd tonight in this! Literally so worth it!! The quality is amazing for the price and it feels amazing!!I don‚Äôt want to take it off!!First glance I thought wow that‚Äôs gonna be uncomfortable girls it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs brilliant I love it I will be ordering more as I always do. All of my outfits are from avid love they don‚Äôt go wrong

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The material feels way better than expected for the price the front fits well and the back is not quite tight enough but you can‚Äôt tell by the look. (Put it on briefly, So probably need to adjust) the skirt is long even in heels but I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù Even with that really happy with the quality and it‚Äôs flattering. I‚Äôm very specific and iffy with how things look on me. This product deserves 5 stars. Ordered a large and I‚Äôm 170, give or take. Excited to order more from this brand.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It fit as expected. I purchased a Medium, I am a size 8/10. The material stretches, so there is some play room. If you wear heels with it the wrap won‚Äôt be too long. Overall WE really like this product.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  In loveeeeee with this set (im 5'3 & the skirt is really long) but its still nice and sexy. The quality is also nice and the skirt is somewhat thick. Just put some sexy heels and you're good to go.

  I want to start by saying that it looks like the pics. The straps are adjustable so you can customize the fit a little. The only reason I‚Äôm giving it 4 starts is for the skirt. The skirt is soft and it looks cute on the pic. But on me, I didn‚Äôt like the skirt tied like on the pic. I styled it over one shoulder like a sarong. So that is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. But the quality of the piece is excellent for the price.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I didn‚Äôt like that the skirt was so long. The teddy was sexy and fitting. If your under 5‚Äù1 the skirt may be too long.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very small. The 2xl has enough fabric to cover a small but with longer elastics. The skirt is not large enough for anything maybe over a medium

  The fabric is sooo comfortable and the color is extremely rich. My boyfriend loves when I wear this piece. Sometimes I'm a little self conscious of my tummy area (like most people here), but this forgiving while still being alluring. A definite must-add to your lingerie collection!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I always order large or extra large because i am every bit of my huge breast measurements for my top are under bust is exactly 35.5. Inches and peak bust is 44.5 inches which if i can find a bra in the correct size is 34 H or G or 36H or. G BUT THATS WISHFUL THINKING,  SO i ordered this in a large and the panties fit perfect and so does the top which is very shocking  because normally large bottoms are to big with a large top in a set because i usually buy my panties in a large 7 or 8 or most of the time a meduim size from target. This set feels great its so soft and the paties do not roll, sage or bunch up they fit just LIKE the model photograghed online. I am vert impressed and i will most definitely be buying more from this company. And so will my husband because these he really likes on me... .

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was a little skeptical at first, Im a bigger girl and to put it plain and simple almost everything i order online doesnt fit. But this,oh this is beautiful. It fits PERFECT so soft, made very very well the quaility is awesome and i feel so sexy wearing it. The color seemed a little off but i can push my OCD to the side to enjoy the nights i put this on.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Arrived a few days earlier than expected, the color is nice it's more of a light blue than a sea foam green depending on lighting. The material is also soft ,it does fit a tad big but it's nothing a quick normal wash and dry can't fix. I'm about 5'8 145 lbs, 36 C. I could have ordered a small if I wanted a tighter fit I can stretch the top a good 3 inches from my ribs before washing. I suggest delicate cycle if you don't want it to shrink. Very satisfied with my purchases from Avidlove so far. :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This babydoll is so cute and sexy! Fits really well, I wear a size 16 pants and usually an XL-2X top and the XXL fit perfect! For the price you cannot beat this babydoll, I honestly want to buy another in a different color.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love it! The rose color is darling and fits well. I'm a little chubby, 170 pounds, wear 38D size. I normally wear large t-shirts, but I ordered a XL. The lace bra top and panties fit perfect, only had to adjust the straps for support.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered a large.  I'm 5'3 & 155 lbs. Loved that you could adjust the straps which helped lift the ""girls"" & made them look full and perky. I have a big booty and the panties fit well.  My bf loved it!! I think it took me longer to put it on than it took him to take it off,  lol.  Loved the price and was delivered sooner than the date given.  Great purchase!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My man started drooling when I came out wearing this. Fits perfectly and gives a nice little tease show in the back.

  I am so impressed by the quality of this set ! Perfect neutral color ribbed material but super soft inside. I love it ! I got it in a size XL and I am a size 12 for reference. I think this would also make a great Christmas gift for a mom, wife, sister, or friend.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  First things first: this set is super cute & super comfy! I slept in it last night and I didn‚Äôt get too hot or too cold! It‚Äôs soft & I washed & dried (low heat) & still looks brand new! My only complaint‚Äî which is solely based on me being short and my figure gets lost in loose clothingüôÉ is that the shorts are a little baggy on my hips & the top is giant on me so if I don‚Äôt tie the top in a front knot I look like a sack of potatoes‚Äî & that‚Äôs all on me thinking I gotta look cute in my own damn house where no one is seeing me lmao! (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, 130lbs, fitness instructor for reference) I got the large bc I know the actual elastic waistbands on these cheapy sets squeeze my soul out of my body & I hate that when I‚Äôm sleeping! I 100% could have done a medium, but like I said tight af clothing for bed drives me crazy! I hope that was helpful lolol!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very cute pajamas, but I did wash it in the washer, instead of hand washing it like it directed me to. What can I say? I‚Äôm a rebel. It shrunk so now it‚Äôs slightly snug. The top doesn‚Äôt lay off by shoulder like in the photo. Maybe if I use my foot to stretch the inside, it can? Idk. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 135 lbs and got the small. I could have gotten a medium and all probably would have been well. But whatever. PS. If you have junk in the trunk, go up a size!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this set for the price! Soft material, really pretty color (as pictured), very comfy. I‚Äôm usually between size M and L, and sized up to L thinking it would be a little oversized. The top fits more like a M and the bottom is more loose, almost more like an XL. I‚Äôm smaller on top so this sizing works for me but hope that helps!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  You want to be cute and comfy.... THESE ARE IT!!! Bought them for my daughter and I for a ""galentines"" weekend this year. Now my ""baby"" is 13 and the size of a grown woman, and these cute little pjs were approved by her daddy (for in-house wear only..her booty and those shorts tho lol). Mama on the other hand.... was KILLIN IT!!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||




                    The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†I could live in this all day, EVERY day! Seriously, it is one of the most comfortable two piece lounge sets I own. The material is so soft and has a nice thickness to it. It has real pockets (FTW!) and a working drawstring. I love that the high waist is not only comfortable but also really flattering. Even the sleeves feature an adorable cuffed design. Ugh, it‚Äôs so cute!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The fabric is THICK. Shirt looked like a cropped thermal from the men's dept. Shorts were big and LONG.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This set is quality!! It‚Äôs a nice thick durable set and very comfortable. I also love the rolled sleeves!  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and purchased the small. Will be buying more!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Buena tela, queda como esperaba, lo √∫nico es que el short es un poco m√°s ajustado

  Siempre compro ropa interior de Calvin Klein porque queda a la medida. Esta me encanta; suave y cuando lo lavas no sufre la tela. Me encantan

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  After reading reviews I decided to spend a little more on this brand. Won't happen again. They don't stay in place. Material isn't wide enough in the front to even cover you so they wind up inside you. HATE THEM!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It was not a multipack as expected from the standard Calvin Klein products. Items came all separate in flimsy plastic cellophane. Wanted to give as a present but not possible. Strange to give someone random three pairs of underwear...

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These were a steal! I was a bit hesistant to get these because of the mixed reviews, but I actually like them they go well with right dresses/ pants. They are so comfortable sometimes I forget I am even wearing them. The only thing I would say is that you shouldn't dry these because the material is very light.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Disappointed, they were marked as invisible, which I thought was a plus.  NOT in my case.  In order to be invisible they have to be thin and have no elastic which causes them to not want to stay put.  I found myself readjusting them often

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These are my favorite underwear.  They are so comfortable, they feel like a second skin!  This is an incredible deal that I couldn't resist, as normally one Calvin Klein Invisibles Thong costs $9-$12!  So you are getting them all for half off.  Very happy with this :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Nice thin material. The problems are the seam up the backside and the lack of gripping material at the ""waistband."" They creep down, roll and creat pantylines at the hips.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  They bunch and curl because of side fat which I didn't think would be that bad...But it is. They do their job which is not to show under clothes. 3 stars for doing their job, minus 2 because I hate the side fat and wish they did a better job at hiding it, not emphasizing.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Generalmente uso talla XL, pero est√°s est√°n muuy grandes a comparaci√≥n de otros modelos que he comprado de CK, quiz√°s hasta el mediano hubiera quedado excelente. Eso s√≠ la calidad y modelos muy bien.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I received this item with the package already opened and one of the thongs was missing. Was supposed to be 3 but only received 2 of them (the light pink one was missing). This is a rip off and highly recommend not buying this.

  loved it, I am on the thicker size I usually weee a xxl and that‚Äôs what i ordered true to size

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love it. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù 135 and the medium is perfect. It is so flattering and soft.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm a size 14/16 with no delusions about what that means when it comes to lingerie shopping. This is so flattering, no weird bulges or pinchy areas. Love it, though my husband couldn‚Äôt wait to get it off me. ;)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù & 170ish with most of my weight in my belly and below. I‚Äôve avoided buying lingerie in the past unless it was a loose teddy. This is sooo comfortable and soft AND flattering. Makes me feel so sexy. I have a small chest (A) so I downsized from my usual large to a medium and it fits perfect. Ladies, run to the checkout with this! You will not be disappointed ‚ù§Ô∏è

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was so impressed with the quality. It stays in place on my body and isn‚Äôt too sheer or delicate. I want one in every color.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Whew baby! I LOVEEEEEE it! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 185lbs I‚Äôm normally torn between a medium and large in clothing but I definitely am glad I got the medium because it‚Äôs stretchy! I have to get a few more colors!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is a great piece and it is very soft. I was nervous to purchase this since I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would fit me just right. I am 5‚Äô5, size 32C and 128 pounds. Usually when I buy lingerie I am concerned if it will be too big in the chest area and if it would be too long and hand (I am also short waisted). This fit great! There are strap adjustments so you can fit it to you. Very flattering and seems of good quality. I am definitely going to purchase this in a different color. I purchased in red. It is more of a deeper red than bright, fyi.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It's very soft and fits well. I have a long torso and usually need to find things specifically for tall people, but this is lovely and stretchy. I did go with the XL and I'm glad I did girth wise (32-33inch waist), but it's actually slightly long top to crotch. Which works out fine for my purposes of wearing as a top or under other clothing. Can't really tell it's loose from a spectators view either.

b.tempt'd by Wacoal Women's Lace Kiss Garter Belt,4.1,183,False,https://www.amazon.com//b-temptd-Wacoal-Womens-Garter-Medium/dp/B00I8HR8JI/ref=sr_1_163?crid=2HKWU10901ND2&keywords=sexy+lingerie&qid=1649384847&sprefix=sexy+lingerie&sr=8-163, b.tempt'd , $9.84$9.84 - $18.80$18.80 ,"

  My natural waist measures 30"" / 76cm, I ordered a Petite/Small b.tempt'd by Wacoal Women's Lace Kiss Garter Belt, and this fits on me well, in the tightest setting (it's a ""bra strap"" style closure). It doesn't dig into my skin or ""Muffin top"" me.  However, the belt is very stretchy. I can stretch it out without any trouble, to 6-8"" away from my skin. What this means is, if stockings are attached, they will very likely be pulling downward on the garter belt, and they will succeed in dragging it down onto my ""usual"" waist area, where it will begin to intersect with my panties, (This is the way it is shown being worn in the photograph). That's ok for my usage, but I do wish it were a little less stretchy. I suppose there's a trade off between comfort and ""having to pull it up from time to time"". If you're looking for a belt that has very little give, this is not it.  If your'e looking for a very comfy belt, this may be the one! I noticed that the apparatus that affixes the stockings to the belt is pretty sturdy, and substantial. The front-and-back apparatus concealing ribbons are thick and the cut edge is ""finished"" so as not to fray. The metal parts are appropriately thick and substantial for the job they're doing, and I'm not at all worried that they'll bend or break. The suspender parts are your standard ""Bra strap"" stretchy strap material. The little ""adjuster"" parts that help you adjust the length of the suspenders are also the same powder-coated metal as the attachment apparatus metal bits. This review is of the black version of the product.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought this to pair with sheer thigh-highs for a boudoir shoot, and it worked perfectly.  I am 5'4"", 120 lbs, and I purchased the small in black. The fit is adjustable, so I was able to get it snug on my waist without creating a muffin top.  The clasps are well built, and hold the stockings firmly in place without tearing them.  The clasp straps are also adjustable, so work with thigh-highs of varying lengths. The belt is actually very stretchy, which makes for sexy poses, but probably wouldn't work out so great if I wanted wear this day-to-day since it slides down to my hips very easily.  I've also worn this for dance routines, and it held up well:  the clasps unbuckle easily for removal of the stockings, and the belt is a standard bra clasp, so also easy to remove.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It's very pretty and the small fit well on the 2nd and last hook, my natural waist is about 29 inches. All of the elastic is in the top band so it runs the risk of muffin topping but isn't bad. Beautiful satin ribbon straps with white meal closures. Isn't super long, and the closures grip thin stockings well. Star loss because the material could be softer.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I like garter belts to hold up my pantyhose because I find them more comfortable than one piece panty hose that I am always trying to adjust. This garterbelt is NOT functional.  I gave it three stars because I can still keep it to play dress up in the bedroom for my boyfriend. It is sexy.  Just don't expect this garterbelt to last longer than an hour. I spent all day hiking it up and adjusting my hose. What a PIA!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this belt. It's simple, and it does exactly what it is supposed to - it keeps my thigh highs up. It's really comfortable and doesn't cut into me. I ordered a small (I am 5'1 & 125lbs.) and it fits pretty well. I have noticed that after wearing it several times, it isn't as tight as I would like (which is why I docked it a star).If you're using it for sexy lingerie only - definitely 5 stars.The clips that hold up the stocking are sturdy, and I like that the clasp is like a bra in that it has three settings.**I've washed this in the washer and let it air dry... it still looks great.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I wanted to like this as it's very cute and fit well, and I have other b. tempt'd products that are great. However the clasps on this were nearly impossible to fasten, and then once they were fastened they kept coming undone throughout a low-key evening of dinner out with friends, not like I was putting unusual stress on them or anything. I have two other garter belts so I am used to how fastening the clasps can be a little tricky, but this one really is a problem compared to my others.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is a good simple garter belt all in all. The closures that hold up the stockings are well made. They are a bit challenging to get closed, but that may be user issues rather than product issues. I'm pretty thin - 5 foot 3 and about 110 lbs and the small fit well. Though the small petite would stretch a lot! It stays up on me but I also have it set to the tightest of the 3 closure settings. It's pretty on, and looks good with black stockings like the picture. The back closure is well made, and overall I'm happy with the product.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Right out of the package I knew I was going to be pleased with this garter. It's very lacy and comfortable and when I wear it I feel very sexy. The hooks are metal so they are much more durable than garters I've gotten with plastic hooks. I love to wear this on Fridays to work to add a little spice to the work days. Definitely recommended!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love this product! Great fit, super soft and sexy! Will buy again and again!

  Love this and came with a string üëåüèæ Gonna order again but in different colors

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  not really true to size but it‚Äôs ok

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This looks SO sexy on. It‚Äôs not as long as the picture showed but it comes down past my butt to wear around the house. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 263lbs and wear a 38DD bra size so I got an XL

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I usually wear a 14/16 pants and XL shirt..I ordered the 18/20 because I wanted to make sure I had plenty of room in the robe..ended up being a bit smaller than expected. I wish they had another size up and that would probably fit the way most people anticipate a robe to fit. The sash is more of a ribbon than an actual robe sash. I ended up trashing it. Overall, nice robe for the price but definitely runs small and might need to grab a better quality sash to go with it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  For anyone who doesn't feel body confident,give this a try! Warning to ladies with bellies,this robe just closes barely.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not the best picture but I actually use this to wear with my bathing suit. It does run kind of small.The lace did snag on my ring.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I had higher hopes for this piece!The lace itself is not bad, had it been based on that alone I would have kept this robe.I am short, 5'2 and this robe was too short on me! The tie is just a piece of ribbon and doesn't look classy when tied.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Would have preferred a better quality belt.. and belt was almost too small for the size I purchased.

  Bought these robes for my mom and 6 bridesmaids to wear as we got hair and makeup done before my wedding. Everyone was so happy with their robes. Very comfortable, fit each person as expected, and kept all hair and makeup untouched as we got into our dresses. We are very happy with these!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is a cute robe. I bought it in a medium to wear at the hospital after delivering (I‚Äôm 7 months pregnant in the pictures.) I don‚Äôt know if I will or not. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù, 145lbs and it‚Äôs pretty short on me, but it still covers everything. The material feels nice, but it also makes it slide around on your body easily.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this robe and feel so fancy when I wear it! The satin is so smooth to touch and the lace features are gorgeous. This robe just likes to slide open eventually as you wear it because it's so smooth and can't stay together. It needs an extra tie on the inside so that it will stay tied, but otherwise, it's great!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This product is kind of the definition of you get what you pay for. My biggest con with it is that the belt for the robe is pretty much useless because it always comes undone. Even when it‚Äôs tied, I feel like too much movement in it is eventually going to expose you. I like to wear this with nothing underneath and if I‚Äôm even walking around my house, too much movement causes the belt to go loose, unravel the tie and expose my chest entirely. The robe itself is relatively thin but definitely not transparent. The color is very vibrant and it has that nice satin sheen similar to the kind that you would see on bonnets. I am 5‚Äô11 and this is actually a really nice length for me. The sleeves are 3/4 (they pass my elbows) and the robe rests about 2-3 inches above my knee when I‚Äôm sitting and 4-5 inches as I walk. I like to wear it when I first get out of the shower because it is lightweight and it is soft on the skin. If you are looking for something cheap and convenient or something to achieve the look of a nice looking robe, specifically for wedding pictures or for your wedding party I would go for this but just know that it‚Äôs not necessarily the best quality of something that you might be able to find on Etsy or an actual wedding party website that sells quality satin robes.

  The product photo is deceiving! The top of this robe remains way too open no matter how tightly you tie it. It even has an inside tie to keep the robe on your body, but you can't exactly answer the front door wearing this unless you're wearing a top underneath. Unless you're a super risqu√© type of gal...The material is smooth and silky, which feels nice, but it slides around on your body as a result. Otherwise, I do like the length of the robe, particularly because I'm a shortie. It's very lightweight and perfect for the hot summers here. It stayed in one piece after washing, but I'll be sure to keep it out of the dryer because it's delicate. It air-dries very quickly but remains wrinkled. The waist tie falls off easily because there are only two loops to string it through, and it's very slinky. I love the peacock blue color and the lace trim! This robe isn't a bad value - when it's on sale.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought this for my Mom for Christmas.  She loved it.  She says it is very soft, but most importantly it keeps her warm.Lovely gift.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This was just what I was hoping for: good fit, nice and soft, not too bulky, and just the right length. I will definitely buy another one when the time comes.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is an outstanding value!  Perfect if you don‚Äôt want a full bathrobe.  Snuggly- perfect!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this robe, it is so flattering and comfortable ! True to size  and lovely quality. I am going to buy more . Thank you :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The purple is such a nice colour, veryyy close to what it looks like in the picture so I'm sure it probably goes for all of the colours too. Feels smooth and very precisely stitched too. Overall, a very nice one.Ps. can be used as a gift too!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So cheaply made hemline totally jagged and strings hanging out and does not stay tied a large is like a small. Don't waste your money.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I purchased 2 in dark blue & 2 in black . I am happy with all of them however I believe the navy is a heavier quality satin & better quality than the black , the lace is tasteful & well made as well . All in All a good purchase .

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This robe is so perfect! I am in love with it. Its so pretty and I feel sexy in it because of the length and the feeling of the satin on my skin. My hubby likes it too for the same reasons üòâThe fit is exactly as I ordered (large), and looks exactly like the picture. I'm actually looking to see if there's any matching sleepwear for it.

  I am hystericalLaughing!! This is seriously meant for a size 0XS person‚Ä¶ not for anyone curvy and shocked the girl in the picture could fit this. Stretched it to the fullest on my arms for one pic and the other is how it came. Very disappointed

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Sizing said it will fit, did not at all. I don't have a huge chest either. Had extra fabric sticking out on right chest area.  Not cute at all. This looked cute so I'm super disappointed.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is super sexy and seductive. Looks can be deceiving but pre stretch it with a gentle hand and put on slow careful not to rip. It fits. I love this and he will too

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This was supposed to be for plus size üòí. Looks like it's for a baby doll. Could not pull over legs without starting to tear.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  A lot of the reviews comment on the size, which is hard to ignore. When we first opened the package, we thought we were sent a glove by mistake. However, my 5'7' wife was able to fit this just fine, as it stretched to her size.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Husband loves but I would definitely stick to handwash only.  Very delicate material. Would not attempt to put in washer

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is good if you are short and very thin. Normal girls this is not for you due to ridiculous sizing.

  I was happily surprised fit perfect has some stretch could have actually went with a large

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I got Medium and love how it fits!  5'5  135lbs  A small would have been perfect and snug.  This is the cutest set <3

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love it fits me perfectly my bf loves it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Again my gf loved the color and it fit her perfectly. She has a very nice behind and it really brought attention to it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs so stunning and the underwear is actually really cute lol

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  A lot of reviews said this ran large, but an XL worked well for my frame. (5‚Äô10‚Äù, 170, 38D). The panties are a tad large, but overall a good fit with sexy, comfy lace. Quality is comparable to what you‚Äôd get at a brick and mortar shop too.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Beautiful color and this lingerie was a perfect fit!!  My boyfriend loved the details and lace.  I will definitely be buying from this company again!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Man I been looking for a gray piece of lingerie for about 3 months now, have already bought several that didn‚Äôt work out. This one is the one, the lace is so soft and beautiful. The back of it is not not completely backless as described in description, it has a bra hook at the top then the rest is a crisscrossed strapping and lace. Its just enough skin shown along with the lace to drive your partner crazy.... I‚Äôm absolutely in love with the thong that comes with these garter sets. They are beautiful lace in front, then in back ,instead of just your usual strings, it‚Äôs a lovely detailed lace design. Soooo cute ! Very comfy the entire outfit is comfy, I have worn this thing for 12 hours straight if not longer. It conforms to your curves, in the omg this is hot way. It does have some stretch to it also. Not restrictive at all. I have 3 or 4 of these now all by avid love. I have bought the Same items from other sellers only to see there‚Äôs a 3 to5 inch difference in the pieces, others seem to run smaller . When I put the thongs up side by side I could even see the difference in size. So I will say avidlove runs true to size. Avidlove is my number one company for lingerie.  Would recommend to anyone looking to buy lingerie. Also the garter straps are adjustable.  They never come unhooked either unless you unhook them.

  I thought from the picture, it came with the garter, they do not. And do not stay up well without a garter. So I'm a bit disappointed with that, but it's my fault for not reading more carefully. I was in a rush to get them ordered. Now I need to find a garter in time for the weekend. -_-

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Nice fit , very plain , darker and a little thicker than I expected. But very nice , not hot , and they don‚Äôt run easily! I wear thigh highs at least once a week, so it‚Äôs important that mine last at least two or three wears. Glad that they don‚Äôt have the silicone on the inside at the top, I find those kind hard to stay clipped in most of my garter clips. So it‚Äôs nice to have these, no struggles just pull on and clip em in. Great price too! Highly recommend!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  They fit my ""thicker than normal"" thighs!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5'9 and I usually wear xl bottoms. I. Not a one size fit all. As you can see the thigh highs attached perfectly with the lingerie. My thighs are moderately thick so I knew I would need queen size. The stretch is really good and the thick was of the tight is just right.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These are barely knee high stockings. The top lacy band is not stretchy enough to accommodate thicker thighs. They are cute, but disappointed because they kept sliding down from my thighs and would not stay in place. These I think are more geared toward people with thinner thighs.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Had snags coming out of the package. Read the description carefully, the garter belt does not come with it and there is no rubber liner in the thighs to hold it up so they ended up looking like loose saggy snagged knee high socks. I used the size chart but these were also too big.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  No rubber grip to keep it in place.  I knew it wouldn't come with a garter but they are very big.  I ordered an XL but should've got just L.  Good quality, excited to try them out and about

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered the one size plus/Queen size. I'm 5'2"" and wear a size 8/10 jeans. My thighs measure 24"" and my calves 14"", the size was perfect. The stockings rest nicely around my thighs it's not tight or snug. For someone with thicker legs the stockings do have more give to them. And the material feels sturdy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Absolute crap. Advertised as ""thigh highs"" but have no means to stay up at all and would have to be used with garters. If I lived in the UK I would return it but I just didn't have time to deal with it on a vacation so I will just throw them out.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very disappointed in these. Ordered queen size as per size chart. They are too tight in the thigh area. And these are NOT stay up stockings at all. They roll. And don't have the rubber lining inside the lace part to be true stay ups like the ones la senza sells. They barely stayed up with a garter belt. Waste of money!!! Don't buy!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  ... maybe I can't read lol , but they don't stay up, need garters.  Quality seems fine.  These are shorter than my other thigh highs too, hits lower thigh area so need longer garters.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Sadly, they didn‚Äôt fit my upper thighs, they rolled down to above my knee. lol. They were beautiful fabric and quality, but the upper thighs weren‚Äôt for us queens. 3 stars for the quality and fabric. But size matters in this case!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very sexy thigh highs! Only downside is that there's no rubber lining at the top so they slide down constantly if you're not wearing something to hold them in place.

  I bought these to goe with a specific lingerie set and the look awesome together. Plenty of stretch, I've used them several times now and they're holding up great. Perfect size for big thighs.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Would give 0 stars if could and 10 stars for embarrsment!  Bought for a formal dance party.  2 hours in the elastic stretched and they fell to my knees on the dance floor.  I was SO embarrassed.  DONT BUY!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I received this item as an Amazon add-on perk and am more than pleased. Quality stockings are difficult to find at a decent price point so I was more than happy to purchase a reputable brand like Leg Avenue for $2. I was pleasantly surprised that the thigh highs I got have a lace top as opposed to the bow top as pictured; however after re-reading, I realized the description does state that they're lace top. I'm 5'9"", 135, and thin and not only do these fit perfectly, but they're comfy and more durable than other lace top thigh highs I've bought. I'm glad I bought two pair and would highly recommend to anyone thinking of purchasing this add on item!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  If you have any fat in your legs dont buy these... The plastic that keeps them up is so tight it pushes any fat on your legs out of the top of the stockings. Not flattering at all  and Im only 135 and my legs are not that big

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Good for teeny tiny legs. If you have any muscle they‚Äôre not great. They just roll down.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits perfectly and comfortable just as in the picture.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love them and they do a good job of staying put while doing the splits, and dancing around everywhere. Love them 0:-)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Choose the one size fits all & it worked perfectly. Paired with a Sexy Santa Baby Doll for a fantastic Xmas Eve at hone

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Small fray barely visible but will probably get bigger, otherwise a very reasonable quality for the price. 6'0 155lbs fits great

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Arrived quickly and was super cute and fit well. However, whenever I walked for even a short minute, the tights would fall down no matter how high I pulled them. Had to continuously readjust them throughout the day!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs very nice

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Stays up 100%Planning on wearing it with my maid lingerie!

  This material is exquisite, THICK and so soft, so stretchy the color is just not as depicted got the pale blue, but it's more pale and dark not the soft teal blue color in the pictures, otherwise freakin fire, 100% recomend

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Literally so cute made my boobs look so good I love it runs a little small so if you have thick thighs size up I got a medium

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super flattering set! Very compressive

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love this bought one in every color !! I ordered a large . I wear a 36dd and the top fits great, the bottoms super stretchy and great thick material.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was so skeptical about this but it was PERFECT! I loved the material. It was thick and stretchy! It accentuated curves I didn‚Äôt know I had. I felt super sexy in it. I ordered a large to be safe because I‚Äôm top heavy but it was still great!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I have a very large chest and the top didn‚Äôt quite look right on me so unfortunately I will be returning.. but I would definitely recommend for others! I wish it would have just had a tiny bit more coverage for my liking. But the material and stitching is amazing and it is very cute! I would definitely recommend to try it, great quality and price!!

  ¬†If this was a name brand set they would be charging you $50 for the top and $50 for the bottom! The cut is very flattering, it gives support on the top, and the bottom doesn‚Äôt create any bunching that other cheap athletic bottoms can.The fabric is thick and stretchy, and the control top keeps my midsection sucked in so that my figure looks cute while I‚Äôm working out (it might sound silly, but that‚Äôs super motivating to me üòÜ)DEFINITELY get this one ladies, you won‚Äôt regret it! üíóI am 5‚Äô5‚Äù, 127 pounds, and I got a small!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The top is fabulous, the shorts... not as cute or as flattering as I had hoped. However, I am only 5 feet tall and longer shorts generally aren‚Äôt too flattering on me to begin with which is why I‚Äôm still giving this 5 stars. The purchase is worth it just for the top, it‚Äôs great for the gym and you can even pair it with jeans to wear if you‚Äôre going out for drinks. SUPER comfy. I purchased a size small. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô tall and 110lbs.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered the matching workout shorts and top and it was terrible quality. First of all the material used was not the material shown in the picture advertised. The sizes were not as mentioned and were a horrible fit. Extremely disappointed in this product and the shop.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Waste of money. Threw it in the bin. Cut and fabric is very cheap nothing like the pictures

  Meh.... Lol. They are really cute but I'm disappointed. The toes.... These guys could not have made it so my toes aren't poking out of the holes of the stocking... It looks ridiculous guys, come on. Not very sexy.They fit okay, a little snug but looked good on me. I'm 5'7 and 135 pounds. They are so not comfortable though! Kind of itchy and I want them off after about five minutes which kind of defeats the whole purpose of wearing them.So, they are okay but not great. I'll keep looking for something better.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm tall and these actually fit me! They do really nicely being washed. I throw them in with my regular loads of clothes. Love them. One pair will usually last me all year, I wear them regularly. So much more comfortable than full tights.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm a plus size woman.. size 12-14..  The band stayed around my waist no problem..and didn't roll down very much.. but the ""garters"" are far longer than they should be. This caused the garters to fall down below my mid thigh.. to almost right above my knee. They also weren't very comfortable to wear.. they don't feel very luxurious.. they almost feel a bit scratchy. I wore them underneath a pencil skirt to a romantic date with the boyfriend. they stayed on fine and I couldn't feel them move.. but when I disrobed that evening.. I had to fix them before the boyfriend saw me. I won't purchase again.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  As a whole, the stockings/garterbelt are lovely, and I'm happy to have them. That being said, these do not have much elasticity to them, so please be cautious and order only if you're within the size requirements. The size is roughly suitable to someone who is about 5,6 (I'm roughly 5,8 to 5,9 myself). At my size the material is definitely a bit tight, and I did feel i was going to tear the fabric.Overall really pretty, but make sure it will fit before you buy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Just a warning that I'm typically a small/ or size 6 for clothes and this kinda ripped going over my hips? Which are not very big. So just be careful with them and slide em on slow. Also the toes peeping through them.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5'2 and 160lbs and this product was too small for my thighs. also one thigh was tighter than the other. so Im returning it. it is stretchy on the other parts except where it matters.The part that goes around the tummy is also really thin so it doesn't sit very well ‚Ä¶

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5'4 130 pounds and these fit me perfect

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Looks very sexy in the picture but the size guide is not even close to correct. My wife was right in the size zone and it was so tight she could not wear them.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Est√°n pensadas para mujeres altas o con piernas muy largas. Mido 1.63 y las puedo utilizar sin problema solo que me quedan un poco m√°s arriba de lo que se le ven a la modelo. Son lindas y se ven muy bien. Solo hay que tener cuidado al retirarlas ya que se enredan con facilidad.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered a plus size and I'm not a true plus size woman (I'm a size 10) the fit was too small.  There is no way this would fit a woman that is a size 12 or more.  Very disappointed!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These were a nightmare! Apparently I do not have the necessary PhD required to untangle these enough to even get one toe in them. Not worth it- I tossed them out.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Cant go wrong with leg Avenue.always fir and look amazing

  seems cheap

  Edit, two years later!This lingerie is still fantastic! It's lasted well, without any of the lace falling apart or becoming scratchy. It's stood the test of several costumes, as well as getting rave reviews in my love life. I bought another color about a year ago (red), which was a great vibrant color, exactly as pictured, and felt and fit the same as the first one. I may just buy another color this year!2019 review:Oh my god. This is great. I'm 5'1"" and about 275lbs, which I carry around my lower belly, butt, and thighs. I purchased the 4X. This item is amazing. It fit perfectly. Some things to note in particular:- It's not scratchy. It's very comfortable. Sometimes lace and fishnet material gets scratchy, but this is not just comfortable but borders on soft.- The crotch snaps are barely noticeable. You know they're there, because you saw them or used them to put it on, but you can't feel them when the item is actually on.- The straps are adjustable. This really helped me because I was able to adjust the straps so the top of the teddy actually held my boobs in place (I wear a 42DD).I'm just honestly really overwhelmed. I ordered this item to use for Halloween, and I had my doubts. It didn't have very many reviews, but it was a low price, so I went for it. It came within two days (Prime), fit exactly like I wanted it to, and, the cherry on top, it was a low price. I highly recommend this. Plus size girls gotta stick together, so I made sure to write this review right after trying it on.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm very happily surprised at how nice this is for the price! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù currently 140 Lbs & 34D. I‚Äôve gained 10-15 lbs recently and carry that weight in my belly and chest so I wanted something to cover that.  I have a short torso and this fits great lengthwise so I‚Äôm not sure if it would be great for someone that‚Äôs taller, but there are adjustable straps to give a little extra room. There is no support in the bust, but with the way it‚Äôs low cut, it still looks great. Also, fits awesome on the butt. It cuts high up and doesn‚Äôt leave anything to the imagination in the back, but with the front covered, that‚Äôs a plus. I‚Äôm surprised at how soft it is too!Only con is that it smells like chemicals. I hand washed it in the sink and it bled badly. I‚Äôd suggest only handwashing for this reason.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 190lbs and I got this in a XL. I LOVEEE this! I felt very confident and sexy when I tried it on and my boyfriend liked it too!! I wanna wear this everyday

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'9 165lbs. 40,35,43 measurements. I ordered the Xl and the fit is amazing. The quality is suprising for the cost. The lace is soft and silky, not itchy like some other lace lingerie I have purchased. The button closures are quality. The color is exactly as advertised. Excellent quality and find for a cheap price!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Loved this body suit! It fit like a glove great quality!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I absolutely love this outfit. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 145 lbs with 36 DDDs at my age I‚Äôm super proud of them üòù. I got a large and it fit good. Little loose on the rear cause all my goods are up top (unfortunately). I paired this with a black mini shirt and strapped heels for a night out.  I threw over a white button up just in case people said anything.  I‚Äôve never felt sexier.  My husband was happy.  Win win

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'3 and 150lbs. Womens size 6/8. I am hippy. The medium is way too tight down below, but I bought this as lingerie so, it serves its purpose. I could never wear it out in day light with an outfit. The V comes way further down below than the photos portray. But I do realize that I may need a large. But again, its fine for me. I would say order a size up. The material and quality is as expected. Thank u!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Really happy with this item! I am 5'6"" and a 42D cup and a size 20 in pants, I wear a 1 or 2 in stores like Torrid for panties, I carry all my weight in my tummy due to diastasis recti. I wish this had just a liiiiiiittle more chest support, but the cleavage angle is flattering anyway. The lace is a nice thickness and I like the strategic panels that offer peekaboo but not totally sheer. I ordered a 4X and I don't think changing size would make a difference; it fit just right in terms of tightness, not uncomfortable but not too loose either. I may buy it in more colors! It came in a frosted plastic zip-top bag.

  Color: BlackPurchased Size: SmallI am 5'5"", 135 lbs, and a 34D. I typically wear a standard, US women's size 4.I purchased this for a Britney Spears costume. It was actually very comfortable to wear. Overall, the fit was true to size for me.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  A very cute and sexy skirt with a ton of potential, but it wouldn't even cover 1/2 of my wife's bottom even when she was standing straight.  She wanted super short, and is not shy, but there is just no way anyone could ever wear this except maybe over a bikini, which defeats the ""flirt"" purpose.  5'2""  with full hips, so got a size Large: Front length hits 1.5"" below crotch (okay), but the back would need another 4 inches just to reach down to a point that a full 1.5"" of cheek would show.  Unfortunately, we had to return it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  my sister should not be allowed to wear this

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Actually an impressive skirt, nice material. Other than a comment saying 'skirt fits as regular size' I didn't see a size chart per se, but i used my/the standard (US) size(s)... & its two thumbs up Perfect!! I like the mini skirt style, material, fit.. Very pleased üåπ Well made/stitches, nice pleaded skirt. üëç

  This skirt is absolutely adorable and fits great! I would recommend this for sure.

  Very soft material, which I thought contained some spandex, but it does not. I am heavy on the top - this night gown would have been GREAT if It contained cups for support - it is too loose on top, letting my breast hand slightly :( I purchased an XLarge, but probably could have gotten away with a Large. But I do not think the Large would have solved the issue with my breast. I have decided not to re-purchase, but to search for a nightgown with spandex so it hugs alittle more on my body.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  FITS AND FEELS AMAZING. Super soft and very comfortable to sleep in.. but beware if you have nipple piercings and your boobs fall out over night, it does get caught.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5ft 1, 200lb i bout a 2x and it was form fittingso it runs small, i was hoping for a little looser fitlooked really nice, very soft fabric

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is the softest nightgown! I am a ‚Äúhot sleeper‚Äù and this modal fabric is perfect- feels like you‚Äôre wearing almost nothing! Lace is not itchy at all (something I have found in other similar items), and it washes well too! It is a little more form fitting than I had expected but so comfortable it‚Äôs ok! Would highly recommend!!

  This product is very comfortable, good quality, and true to size.I'm 5'6 and between 145 and150 lbs. I ordered a large because I wanted a roomy fit, which is what I got. A medium would actually fit more appropriately, but I like the extra room.That being said, I ordered 6 in black, and hope to order more, which will probably include some mediums.

  Its amazing. Its made well can be worn as gown or sun dress. Shipping was fast. Will definitely  order again. For ref. I am 5'7 180 lbs and I ordered an XL

  DO. NOT. BUY. this is the only time I have ever been disappointed with amazon workout gear but wow I am so disappointed. First of all, it took 2-3 weeks to get here and was lost in tracking shipment for days. And then I tried it on and it looked like it was made for a child. SO THIN, NOT HIGH WASTED, could have made a better quality set out of floss myself. Do not recommend.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  If your thinking about purchasing this ... DONT EVEN THINK TWICE BUT THIS . BUY THIS RIGHT NOW . Literally the most amazing thing . Maybe your a bigger girl and your wondering ‚ÄúHMMM should I get this ‚Äú YES . YES YOU SHOULD . Do it immediately.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  First of all, in the pieces I received looked poor quality. When being stretched you can see through. There is no thickness to the material. The top and bottoms poor seams, just stitched together no controlling stretch to prevent from rising up.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am gonna assume that this seller either has different manufacturers and sometimes you get a good quality set and sometimes you get a bad one. I did have to wait approx 2-3 weeks until mine arrived and I was hoping I wouldn't be disappointed, and I wasn't. I bought another style from this same seller that has 4.5 stars and added that to a pic to see the comparison (light blue set). This set came with the same quality and fit as the set that was 4.5 stars; it is nice and thick, not see-through, and hugs all the right curves. The bra came with removable pads and in the photos I took them out so I do not know how the bra fits with them in. I would recomment taking a chance on this set, hopefully you get the good quality one. The only issue I seemed to encounter was there is no tag on the shorts so I wasn't 100% sure what was the back and what was the front, also the inside stitching seems a little sketchy, so I wont be putting this in the dryer or washing on a high tumble speed. I would strongly recommend, and I hope you get lucky to get the nice set. [5'1, 145lbs, got brown color in a Medium]

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love these! Fit perfectly. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and weigh 127. They suck in/hide the little bit of loose skin/stretch marks from having my baby. The material is thick but not so thick that it feels sweaty. The top holds the girls in great as well, although I‚Äôm only a C cup so that‚Äôs not saying much hahah I definitely recommend these though.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm obsessed with this outfit. Thick, quality fabric that hugs and fits perfectly! I bought it in 3 colors and love them all.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I loved everything about it! I got a M and I‚Äôm 170-175 range. 5‚Äô7 and it fits perfect! Super stretchy as well

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Set is perfect. I am 5‚Äô2 and weigh 140 I got a medium and it fits perfect. I‚Äôm always in between a small and medium but this medium fit. I love the top and fits perfect I‚Äôm a 36 c so medium worked.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My first review was ""flagged"" because I requested refund!do not purchase this item!it was not at all what was advertised, the only thing the that was right about this item was the colour.this wouldn't have fit my 8 year old. it was see thru, there are holes in the seams and the material is NOT what they show in the picture.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  DO NOT ORDER! This product is absolutely horrible! The wrong colours arrived as well as they were the completely wrong size and see through. The worst quality product! When requesting a refund they suggested I gift it to a friend!! Absolute awful product and even worst service! Never order these sets or anything else from this company!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is not a seamless fabric, and the colour i is definitely not as shown. I ordered brown and it is a burgundy colour, and the fabric is a thin flimsy ribbed jersey material. Definitely not a work out set.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very thin material. Runs small. Top came with a hole in it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs literally the thinnest material every and SO see through. There is no way this is meant to workout in. The top also has no support.

  Finding Lingerie that flatters my shape is difficult for me because I have a short torso, small bust along with hips and a butt so it's usually a miss. After seeing some of the pictures reviewing this product, I wanted to give it a try and I'm glad I did! I LOVE this product. Although my product looks different from the pic, it is the same. I am only 5'2, 125lbs so I had plenty of room to stretch it down lol. At first, I wore it like the picture but to me, it didn't flatter me that much so I played with moving the design down to give my torso a bit more design and I'm glad I did. Lingerie is suppose to enhance what you naturally have. :) I hope this picture helps diverse this product a bit because it truly works for many body shapes and all ethnicities.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super sexy , I love the fit, hugs my body in the right places. My husband loved it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very sexy! Fits my body perfectly and the fabric feels good. As it was mentioned before, be careful when putting on/off as the material is very thin and easy to damage.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not the best quality material, and putting it on I'm scared I'll rip it with my acrylic nails, but definetly sexy and form fittinget. Looks great on and the husband loves it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This product fit like a glove! I am 5'2"", roughly 98lbs, with size 36A bust.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bought this for my wife. Material is super soft, I was expecting a more polyester feel, but this is more like a cotton feel. It's super stretchy, the thing comes in a bag the size of an index card and when she first saw it she laughed and said there's no way that'll fit (she's 5'6ish, 150ish, B cup with hips). It totally fit, and mmmmm. Could wear it on its own, or could wear it over/under other clothes as a tantalizing combo outfit.The one star deduction is because she said it feels like it could fall apart at any moment because the threads are so soft. If it lasts longer than a couple times through the laundry, I'll update to add a fifth star.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This lingerie didn‚Äôt catch my eye at all, but as I was scrolling through Amazon looking for lingerie, it caught my boyfriend‚Äôs eye. I humored him, added it to my cart, and then saved it for later completely forgetting about it. Fast forward a couple weeks and I‚Äôm looking to buy lingerie for Valentine‚Äôs Day. I saw this in my save for later, and though I didn‚Äôt think it was my style at all, I decided to surprise my boyfriend with it because I knew how much he liked it. Well, it ended up being one of my favorite pieces of lingerie! It fits great, accentuates my curves, and, well, my boyfriend LOVED it, so much so, he was rendered speechless. It‚Äôs a little fragile but I was expecting that. Beautiful piece!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Alright so even though this piece didn't fit as I would have expected based on the other reviews, I'm still giving it five stars because the hubs loved it and that's all that mattered to me.  The ONLY issue I had with this piece was in the chest area.  If you have nice, full breast, then you have nothing to worry about.  If you're like me, who sits at a B (but not impressively), then you're not going to look like the girl in the image.  Again, my husband didn't  care about that one bit.  I felt extremely sexy in this and was really impressed at how much stretch it has.  I believe this piece could fit a woman up to a size 14 with no problem.

  Great for my lingerie party! Popped in my pictures!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm a size 6/8 and I wear a 34 D, I bought a large and most of it fit great! The fabric on the band of the bra did fold over quite often and the underwear was oversized. However those weren‚Äôt deal breakers for me!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  When shopping for this lingerie I was really expecting it not to fit. The reviews didn‚Äôt do too much justice. But I will say if you‚Äôre thinking about purchasing please do! I purchased XL, & I am 5‚Äô7 and Weight  190ibs my bust size is 42DD & the bra shockingly fit & held my girls pretty well. So i would say it‚Äôs true to size. My only issue is the bikini area was too big overall & did not fit my large bikini area lol. Also the guarder was pretty flimsy.. but no big deal! It‚Äôs perfect for the bedroom & I recommend

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  If you're on the fence, buy it! I wear a medium in shirts and size 6 in old navy jeans. I'm not skinny but not chubby either. I have a little extra fluff in the middle from having two kids, a decent bum and hips. I have never bought lingerie and this was a great first purchase. I'm a flat 36D because of nursing two kids. The bra was comfy, cute and held the girls in with a little peek on the top. The g string is adorable but about as comfortable as a thong can be. The garter was the best part! So flattering! The back was a little itchy but it's a thin/sheer fabric so I didn't expect silk. The connectors were strange and were hard to put on the stockings but I ended up just letting them dangle. All in all I would buy again!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Was super excited to get this and surprise my husband. I received it in good timing and it was beautiful, however there are a couple downfalls...1. The material is thin and when I pulled it out of the package it already had holes in it in some areas2. It doesn‚Äôt come with stockings so you will need to purchase separately (not too much of a bother, but it would be nice to include what‚Äôs shown in the picture)3. Attaching the stockings to the garters was a PAIN and took so much time. Thank God for a patient husband, but when it came down to business, I went from looking sexy to looking crazy trying to unhook myself and it took too much time trying to get out of this contraptionNow on a positive note, it fit perfectly! The bra made the girls look nice and the whole outfit altogether made me look and feel my best. I am 150 pounds and usually wear a size 10 in jeans or a size M and for bras I wear a 36C. Get the medium, trust me!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I usually wear medium in clothes, so I ordered a medium. Fit just right. I'm 5'0"",140 LBS, 34D, with a 30 inch waist. definitely had some stretch to the garter

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I loved this set so much, feels so comfortable and soft on my skin, does not feel scratchy at all which is a must! I got myself a Medium, since I am a 36 DD. I am a little smaller on the waist, so the middle part fit me a little loose, but wasn‚Äôt much of a problem at all for me because I could wear it however I‚Äôd like. Would definitely recommend adding this to your lingerie collection!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought the green one in medium, it's a beautiful color. I'm 5'0"", 32ddd, 129 lbs, the bottom fit well, the bra cup size was just a little too small for me, but the material is stretchy enough to squish the girls in, but just barely. It would be nice if we could mix and match sizes. Besides that, I love it, the color is very vibrant and is the exact color shown here.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love! I probably should‚Äôve went to my original size but I sized up in case. It still fits and it‚Äôs adjustable but I should‚Äôve took my size because I‚Äôm on the tightest it can go on the garter belt and I could probably go tighter. Underwear were huge but I never keep the underwear with sets I buy so I knew before buying the outfit that I would just be wearing black underwear that I already own.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  but the lace is not as stiff as the kind you get at higher end stores and the medium is quite small - I‚Äôm a 36 C and this is more like a 34B

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  One of my favourite lingerie sets now. I got it in red and I feel gorgeous in it. I‚Äôll definitely be getting another colour in the future!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Wire is bra came out right away. Too bad because it‚Äôs very nice

  I am 5'6"" / 205lbs, these actually fit me quite well without the top lace digging in and giving my thigh a muffin top! I do wish the top had some of the sticky gel to help them stay up, I used a garter belt so not a huge deal but without it they slowly started sliding down and once I unhooked from the belt they just went right down my leg. For the money I am happy and the hubby was very happy with them as well üòä

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I normally wear a size 18 or 2 at Torrid; 5'3 210lbs.  I have pretty heavy thighs.  These fit fine (come up to the upper/mid part of my thigh and fit around my thigh).  Other thigh highs I have purchased in the past are either too long if they fit around my thigh or cut into my thigh if they are the right length.  These are the best fitting that I have tried.  You have to wear a garter belt to keep them up.  They slide right down as soon as you move without a garter.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered queen size.  The chart indicates that queen size is for people 4'-11"" to 5'-10"" and weigh between 160 and 240 lbs.  I am 5'-8"" and weight 165 lbs.  I could just barely get these pulled on to reach the garter straps on my oversize garter belt and those straps are extra long.  The stockings come to just above my knees.  If you are more than 160 lbs and more than 5'-6"" tall I do not recommend you buy these.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Do fall down, has no ""grippy"" texture at the thighs. It has no rubbery lining at the thigh/top. I am 270 lbs at 5' 6"" and they rolled down immediately. But are very low cost, so I got what I paid for.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  They are soft and comfy and I liked the size of the fishnet. But definitely you'll need garters. The tops are Lacey and soft too, but no elastic to hold them up (which I knew after reading other reviews).I tried them with some garters with the metal hearts (you know the ones!) But the tights would fall on the opposite side.I recommend garters with straps on opposite sides. Like a typical garter belt has on the back and front. üòä Enjoy!5'8 170lbs and some thick thighs for reference on my size.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not what I ordered at all. I saw the pictures from other reviews and they got what looks exactly like the picture so I ordered it. Instead, I got regular sized plain black stockings. No lace, no fishnet, and most definitely not plus size. Extremely disappointed. I chose the option to have my order resent with the correct product and I'm hoping I actually get what I ordered this time...

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super sexy! Tried these on a whim with another item and they are very good quality for the price. The fit is great and there is plenty of give in the material to avoid catching and snaring. I'm 5-7 and 168 lbs, the Q1 worked well for me. I would say my thighs are swimmer size and definitely not sticks. I could have sized down, however I appreciate that the extra give will ensure they last more than one use. Definitely to be paired with a garter belt, of which I purchased this one: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0094VP8VC?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1 and together with some heels, wowza. Husband loved it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I found these extra large and for me that is saying a lot. The material is great, soft, and does not tear easily. I have very thick thighs and calves. So regular size stockings are out of the question. My calves are 19.5 inches and my thighs even deliciously bigger. But these just kept falling down. you will need a garter belt with these. I am 190lbs size 12. But the material is lovely!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great as described.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  too long in leg

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought a piece of plus size lingerie which fooled me into thinking thigh high stockings were included, so I found this cheap pair and it served my purposes perfectly(tried ensemble today for long term boyfriendü•∞) considering it took longer to get them on and strapped in compared to how long I was wearing them LOL(never wore a girdle type piece before).

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  No me ha gustado nada,no tiene ni elastico ni silicona en la parte de arriba,con lo cual se resvalan y se caen en cuanto te mueves,no las recomiendo para nada,porque adem√°s de ser caras ,son inutiles

  I always get sucked into buying cheap lingerie on Amazon, and it never works for my 34DD boobs and med waist. This bad boy though... Super sexy, soft, stretchy- but supportive enough to be super flattering. I can shove all my floppy breast tissue into the supportive mesh breast cups and they stay put like i'm 10 years younger. Underwire is perfectly situated to be helpful and not harmful. 10/10 recommend.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  If you are hesitant to buy this because you have large cup and smaller band size, don't be.  I am a 34H/36G and the cups stretched to fit me like a demi.  Lace is so soft too!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The underwire is a huge plus. This soft and silky babydoll is actually flattering on my plus sized lg chested frame. The xlg fit my 38 DDD cup well. Couldn‚Äôt go jogging in it. But that wasn‚Äôt the intent. Panties are chose cheap string things. But over all very cute and fits nicely

  I purchased the wine color in XXL. I am size 18/20 (2X), 40D bust, 51‚Äù hips, 235 lbs. I love how soft and stretchy the lace feels, it is not stiff or scratchy. The cups fit me good and the straps are adjustable. It was just a little small on the bottom half around my hips/midriff, causing the front to lay open wider than I‚Äôd like... I wanted more coverage over my imperfect belly. The thongs that usually come with these sets never fit me right so that was not a big deal. I think there is a little extra room in the top for someone slightly bigger than me but if you are bigger on the bottom half, it won‚Äôt fit right. All in all this is a lovely, sexy set and worth the price!  If you are narrower in in hips than me, get it, you won‚Äôt regret it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  5'6"", 160 lbs, 38D and I ordered a large but could have gotten away with a medium as the cup is the tiiiiiniest bit too big.  This is adorable, good quality ( I have laundered in a lingerie bag on cold/delicate & hung dry several times, all stitching intact), and amazingly has actual real underwire and straps that provide SUPPORT, miracle of miracles.  I wish I could find other pieces with the support that aren't as ""cutesy"".  Great purchase.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I don‚Äôt expect much when I order clothes from Amazon, so this really surprised me at how cute, sexy, and comfortable it is. Makes you feel 100 percent sexy. The lace is not rough/itchy at all. The red/maroon color is gorgeous in person!!! I‚Äôm usually between a M/L with 38C top and I got a Large. Fits me perfectly. I‚Äôm also short, so the length hits me upper mid thigh.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This was a total fail on so many levels.  First off the ""g-string"" that is sent is not even usable.  It will probably fit a 12 year old girl not a grown woman with a developed lower private area.  I am 235 pounds, 5'6"" and wear a 38DDD.  I bought the XXL after reading reviews that if you have a large chest get a bigger size.  I also purchased this because of the underwire.  The underwire is useless.  If you have natural large breasts that hang like most women's do this is not flattering at all.  I was so excited when I got this and wanted it to look good, and it was a disaster from the beginning.  I am sending this back ASAP for a refund!!!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love the very comfortable underwire support and the super stretchy lace that fits a nice range of boob sizes!  I shopped several nicer lingerie retailers and couldn't find anything this well made with this much support for those of us who aren't a C cup or less.  Would totally recommend this as an incredible Amazon find!

  I am 5'6"" and 205lbs. I bought an extra lrg. It is the best designed nightgown I have ever owned. It is comfy, does not let the girls go free or put you in an embarrassing situation when you bend over.It is very thin but oh so soft.When your sleeping it does not gather up in your armpits and try to choke you either.Love, love , love! This nightgown.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought two of these, in different colors. The cotton knit fabric is very soft and breathable. The elastic in the back keeps it in place well, so breasts don't slip out. These are very comfortable nightgowns.One bit of advice: In other reviews, writers express disappointment that their nightgown were not cotton. This is because there are two different nightgowns sold in this listing, and it's not very obvious. If you want cotton, order the first nightgowns shown. In about the middle of the pictures, the style is subtly different, and those are made of rayon. The list states this, but it tends to be lost at the beginning of the large block of text.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I looked through many, many pages of nightgowns on Amazon before choosing this one. I knew I wanted a color my dogs' hair would not stick to horribly or mostly show, as ""whippet glitter"" is unavoidable in my home. The heather gray is really pretty and just as expected. I have ordered from this company before so I knew to get a size small. I am 5'11"" so regardless of my weight I typically have to size up. That is not the case here! That said, it is also not enormous as I have found other smalls to be recently. TTS.The stitching was slightly sloppy in some spots and before trying it on I thought I may send it back and start again. I just put it on a few minutes ago and I am definitely keeping it! It is really pretty. I don't usually like asymmetrical hem lines but the high-low is subtle and pretty. The cut is perfect and would hide anything I didn't want to show. This would be a really great maternity nightgown for ladies before labor. Probably not great for nursing but sexy for before and after pregnancy. I weigh 115 and am usually a size 2. This seems as if it would comfortably fit someone up to a size 6 with no issue.I chose ""no rush shipping"" for the first time with this item and I ended up wishing I hadn't. I really like it! Would definitely recommend.As for washing, I would suggest cool or warm in the washer and line/hang dry to maintain the longevity of the garment. I also often ""hand wash"" my nighties in the shower in luke warm water with dye&scent free soap. Press between two towels and hang up! Works great living in an apartment building with expensive laundry machines.@goose.and.falco are big fans!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  If you are on the fence about buying this - get off the reviews and go buy it. Now. In every color. If you are on a diet and losing weight and not sure what size, get it in all the sizes so you can shrink with it. If you are pregnant and need bigger ones to grow with, get bigger ones and smaller ones.Get. All. Of. Them.This is easily the most amazing nightgown/pajama/clothing item/piece of fabric I've ever put on my body. It's so soft. So slinky. So comfortable. Not too short in the front. Not too low on the top. Boobies can breathe. Legs can move. Straps are in a convenient place that is not binding, but also not loose and annoyingly falling off.Just buy it. And live in it. All the time.I'm throwing out all my other pj's and buying this is in every color.Oh, size perspective... I'm 5'3"", 240lbs and wear a size 18 normally and I got an xl. It fits perfectly.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Lovely fabric (cool feeling!), very, soft -almost feels as if you have nothing on! And though it is definitely flowing/loose fitting, it still manages to be flattering as the neck line is very pretty, as is the high-low front! I think those two features are what keep it from being frumpy looking! If you're looking for a body hugging sexy gown, this is not it, but if you're looking for a comfortable, yet still attractive gown that doesn't scream ""I've given up"" this is it!  As far as fit, I'm 5'3"" 140, very much hourglass (over 10""diff between chest and waist) I'd say it runs a little large. I ordered the medium and will keep it but given the loose fit, I probably could've gone with the small. Laundered well on delicate cycle, air dry.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Perfect for lounging on a warm day...fabric is not as breathable as I thought for a hot day and can be warm to sleep in if you get hot at night. It is smooth, silky,  and very comfortable but just not a cotton cool. I purchased an XX-Large and my 5' 2"" 160 # body loves the roomy flow and shapely drape. The short front style provides a ""non-nightgown"" look for us older gals that still want to look nice while lounging!!! The straps are comfortable (wide style) but not adjustable as you may think by the photo. It hangs low on my short frame but still good coverage. I have ordered an X-Large and will compare in the future.I would have rated a 4 3/4 if it would encourage a more breathable fabric without changing the style or quality!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This gown is very stretchy for sleep comfort and doesn't slip around so my boobs pop out while sleeping.  It covers nicely so I can wear it to breakfast with my grown kids.  Held up well in the wash, no shrinking or shifting.  I'm very happy with it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The material of this nightgown is SO soft.  I am 5/4 and 170 pounds and ordered the large.  It is a little bit on the big side, but not enough to size down.  The rose red color is a lovely shade of magenta.  Overall, I am very happy with my purchase!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs not flattering at all, it makes me look like a giant eggplant but it‚Äôs extremely comfy. Doesn‚Äôt ride up my armpits while sleeping and the material is so soft. Definitely worth buying.The high low hem is longer than expected but prevents you from accidental exposure when bending over

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fabric is very thin. Had it been slightly thicker it wud have been amazing. And the neckline is a little too low.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is a very comfortable and lightweight nightie. Love the colour and lots of room for turning in the night without binding. Love the material and wouldn't hesitate to recommend. √Ä bit on the pricy side but worth it to me.

  I liked ‚úåüèª

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It's a pretty nightie. Shows just enough but not too much. I'm 5""4', 125lbs, measurements 33-25-37 and I got a medium. I could have gotten a small - it was a bit too large in the chest and I had to tighten the straps to nearly over my shoulders. If you're a C cup or bigger you should be fine.The material is soft, it's not see through, but it's very forgiving. It stretches nicely but tightens back up after a wash.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this nighty. I purchased one in every color. So soft and sexy and comfortable, yet modest to wear around the house (in front of our roommate)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  He's happy, I'm happy. Fabric is pretty thin so it doesn't hide much... but that's why I got it! Doubt it will survive many washes, but we'll see. Very cute and good fit/length. Even came with undies, which I didn't realize! This nightgown is perfect for that ""oh I just wanted to be comfortable and cute- you think this is sexy? Oopsie"" play.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Omg.. I am in love with this nightie.. it's so soft and comfortable.. I got a MEDIUM which is PERFECT, I'm In between 143-147lbs(weight fluctuates)... 5'6.5 in height... 34C or 36C bra size(depending if the bra is from China or not)... I want all my favorite colors in this now

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 136, athletic build. I feel like this looks much better in person than in this photo. It‚Äôs very soft and feels good next to the skin. Feels a little broken-in the way you want something you sleep in to feel. The color is rich and saturated. Very beautiful. I will make sure it doesn‚Äôt run in the wash though...I dunno makes me kinda nervous it‚Äôs so saturated. I also wonder if it will hold its shape but I don't expect the world from clothing so affordable. The matching panties are HUGE lol. Well, I guess that‚Äôs relative but they seem bigger than they should be for how big the chemise is(n‚Äôt).I would order another color. I like it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Nice fit. I got size Medium. I'm 5'3 / 133 lbs / 36B. It would have been ideal if just a teeny bit tighter, but going down to a small probably would not have fit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The material is super soft.  I'm 5'4, 107, 32DD and the small fits perfect.  Great for summer time when it's really hot.

  The material was polyester and pretty cheap looking. But it fit really well. Totally cute.

  Love it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This teddy exceeded my expectations so much that I just placed an order for another one. A while ago I purchased some lingerie from Amazon and the sizes were Asin and did not fit. So... I ordered this black teddy a size larger (XL... just in case) and it is too big. I will exchange that one. I am 5'5"", 157 pounds and wear a 38C. I'm approximately a size 12 and sometimes a 10 depending on brand. Just tidbits to help the next purchaser with sizing! The order I placed today is for a size L.This material is soft and luxurious! It is not stiff and scratchy. I'm hooked and will be back for more! The best thing is that I felt really sexy and my guy told me several times how sexy I looked... that was the plan! üòâ Can't wait to see his reaction when I'm wearing the red one!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It's cute! Not the best for busty ladies though. I'm 5'8, 150lbs, and a 36ddd and it fit great everywhere but the boobs

||||||||||||||||||||||||




                    The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù 140 lbs and have small boobs and ordered a medium and I would honestly exchange it for a small. The adjustable neckline makes it super versatile size wise so base it much more on your boob/width rather than ur height. Very soft and can kind of see nipple but not super obvious.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This fits perfect! I bought the XL, I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù and am 185 pounds. I wear Lg so you do need a size up from your normal size. The whole size thing always worries me even with reviews as they usually don‚Äôt say what size they bought. The tie around the neck helps to get the length you need in all the right areas. It looks great on! It is soft to the touch and feels nice on. I just purchased this in white also!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I tired it on first and it looked awful. Then the wife tried it on... SO MUCH BETTER! Looks great and easy access. The aftermath shows up well on the black.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love the colour but the top feels on the large size/too long.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Material is good, but I returned it back. It‚Äôs too big

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very sexy . Fits well , although I went a size up. Material is decent quality and does stretch.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very sexy, lace is pretty and nice and soft. It actually helps my shape. I was worried about my tummy area but the way its cut is flattering. The material is amazing, not thin don't think it will rip very easily. My husband had no complaints.

  Meh it looks better with the stocking removed just too much lace for my wifey.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Size: fits all 90lbs-160lbs. Not cute. I felt like an old man wearing suspenders and knee high socks. Doesn't not fit like model. I'm 5'-3"" and the stockings fit just above the knee. Not to mention that the stockings were too wide and fit lose. And I'm not petite, average at that.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Needs alteration. The garter straps are WAY too long, and I am 6'3"". If you are Andre the Giant, it might fit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5'3"" and 140 lbs. This gave me plenty of room, didn't squeeze my thighs or cling too tight. However, it was a bit big. I think the problem is the straps were too long. I'm short and I wear a 32DDD bra, so there was zero support (which I expected), but why lying down, it was tricky to stay in the thing. I would have liked it to be a little more snug in general. Still, it felt sexy and that's all I ask :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Material cheap

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Huge downfall is the inability to separate the stockings from the rest of the outfit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very sexy!Leggings to not have elastic, so totally dependent upon the garter.Love it!

  I love the print (I have two different ones) and it is very comfy to sleep in. Does not support breasts at all. I was hoping it would be tighter around the rib cage to give a little bit of lift. It‚Äôs not. If you have large mom boobs and you wanna go bra-less this is not the nightgown for you... unless you are ok with with your boobs hanging lower than the cup area on the nightie. I wish they made something like this with a shelf bra.

  I was surprised how comfortable it was. I wanted something sexy enough to wear around the house for my husband and modest enough to wear in my house with my children, so this was a good mix. The material was really soft and very comfortable. I‚Äôm going to get some more in different colors.

  This is the best stretchy nightie!  The comfort makes-up for the not so great stitching. I am going to order more.  The back is a deep v-shape.

  Well completely agree with these ladies it is lovely the material is definitely soft 2the touch. Also there is a open slip in the front with a clamps u slide in.

  Bought this for my wife and it did not disappoint. Great for fantasy and role playing.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  We've tried a few of the 'cheerleader' type cos play skirts before but this is by far the best one.  It's good quality, it's longer than most and there are great color options.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Size was fine. I won't lie, it has only been worn for minutes at a time before it's on the floor. Pairs perfectly with over the knee socks (mine are white with pink stripes). I have not found a top I like with it but I am pretty sure he hasn't even looked at my top. üòâ

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great quality and expedient shipment !!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Nothing to dislike, fits nice, looks good, well make, nice design.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Cute skirt. I have purchased others like this from the same brand before, and this one runs a little smaller than the others...so that was a little disappointing..

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great skirt. The size guide is accurate and the fit is perfect.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Ordered my size small,fit perfect. Really cute. I purchase to role play with the hubby. Good quality. Short, sexy & naughty.

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 so it drug the floor however it‚Äôs very classy and sexy at the same time! Love the dress

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  You must buy!!! THIS DRESS IS STUNNING!!!! I got so many compliments on it for both men and women. The material is thin but not sheer. Go one size smaller than you would usually go. I read comments that suggested that and I was glad I followed them.I bought a small but usually wear a medium.5‚Äô9145lbs32B bust

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  After reading the other reviews I went back and forth on whether or not to order a small or medium. Nobody that had previously wrote a review closely resembled my body type, but generally everyone complained about how this dress was loose in the chest. I decided to write this to hopefully help someone that shares my body type! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and weigh 160lbs. & I‚Äôm a 32 DD. I normally wear medium - large sized tops and dresses. Based on other reviews I went with a size small on this dress (nervously), and to my surprise it fit perfectly! I can see how this dress could be problematic in the chest, however it‚Äôs a haulter tie so you ultimately determine how tight/loose you would like it to fit. The size determines the amount of fabric covering your breasts. If you want it to look a little more bunched, go with a medium. I definitely think a medium would have fit me as well, it just might have had a little extra fabric on the top as you can see in the other review photos.Being that I ordered a small there was less extra fabric so the haulter tie was enough to make me feel secure by itself. I still wore stick-on bra cups for extra security and peace of mind that they would stay put lol.Overall, I ordered this dress 3 days before a last minute event and it was the best purchase. I went to a nice restaurant and right after we were seated I got up to use the restroom and asked the a waitress where it was, she interrupted to tell me how gorgeous my dress was and proceeded to compliment me all throughout dinner. I got complimented in the bathroom, on the street, in the lobby....and every single person gasped in disbelief when I shared it was on amazon for like $50 and prime shipping.Buy this dress! (And size down) You won‚Äôt regret it ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Ok I have no idea how anybody wore this outside without an entire chest balloon falling out but I‚Äôm still in love. It‚Äôs so dreamy you can help but love it. Just realize everyone at some point will see your nipples.I‚Äôm actually using it as my wedding dress, but I‚Äôm going to buy another (two in total) and make a whole new top because my C cups don‚Äôt stay in. At all. In the pictures it doesn‚Äôt look so bad, but honey, it is. Try me.The color is gorgeous and it‚Äôs not a cheap thin material that I expected. I got a blush color but it photographs in low light as a champagne so that‚Äôs fun.I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and it has a few inches past my feet so you can wear heels and it will still be long. I would even hem it but I like when it drags on the floor. So pretty.Love it even though it‚Äôs not even close to perfect.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My daughter needed a dress for her sorority formal but she didn't want to spend a ton of money. We have Prime so she checked Amazon and found this stunning winner! It fit perfectly, although it was long on her (she's 5' 1"" so EVERYTHING is long on her). Rather than have it hemmed she just picked the front up when she had to walk and let it trail behind her glamorously.Her dad was concerned about the high slit in front BUT 1. She's an adult (he forgets) and 2. It actually ended up not being a problem as long as she didn't stand like a weird model deliberately sticking her leg out while simultaneously cocking her hip.The dress came wrinkled (just the nature of satin fabric) but 3 minutes in the dryer with a slightly damp cloth and all the winkles were gone.  The ties are long but she wrapped them around her neck, crossed in back, and wrapped around her waist and it looked great. It also seemed to help with the dress bodice as it didn't sag or gap in any way. For reference, she is super-short as noted, 110 lbs, and bought an xsmall.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My daughter decided she wanted to get this dress for Prom. I actually tried to talk her out of it- Prom is a big deal! I wanted to see her in a high quality dress. But she was determined, so we ordered it. It arrived quickly, and came just as described. The emerald color was stunning. She is not tall, about 5'4"", and with 2"" heels the length was perfect. It was very wrinkly, but a steamer quickly took the wrinkles out. I wish she had done a better job of steaming it, there were a few left on the bottom of the dress that show up in this photo. The fit is loose and drapes. She did have one problem with the chest, it was cut way too low for her. She remedied this easily with some double sided tape and had no problems with it the entire night. Also, it did not look odd with the double sided tape. The only thing that really bothered me was that the tag is sewn into the leg slit, so when she walked or when it was breezy, the tag showed. It really is a very thin material. She took the tag out easily with some sewing scissors. Is it a cheap dress? Absolutely. But it was the look, color, and fit that she wanted. She did buy some silicone ""nipple shields"" but had no problems with these. This is probably not a dress you can wear a bra with unless you have a sticker bra. My daughter is very small so it wasn't a problem. This dress will show body flaws or underwear lines easily, so if there's something you're not comfortable with, just be aware of this. All things considered, it was a pretty great look on her. She was very happy with it and was super happy to save so much money. She looked and felt beautiful. I had my doubts but she was right!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I LOVED this dress!! I got a small - I‚Äôm 5‚Äô 3‚Äù and it just hit the floor when I wore 4‚Äù heels. I‚Äôm around 120lbs with a small B cup and it fit perfectly everywhere for me. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend for somebody with a larger chest, but it was nice to find a dress that I filled out without having to alter it. It was a little itchy around the underarms but only on one side and not bad enough for it to really bother me

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Big hole in the seam. For price, that's ridiculous especially as I paid extra for shipping because its international. The least that could have been was to ship the item without the holes in it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I would normally wear a small or extra small but I purchased a big size in hopes that I could use it as a maternity dress. The straps were really long and the bust was really big but I was able to play around with how I tied it to get a better fit. The colour was really pretty.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  this dress  is perfect and flattering for a curvy body. The neck strings are very long, which actually works well for me to customize how I tie it up. Dress itself is veryyyyy long. I am 5ft4 and wear 4 inch heels and still had a lot of length to cut off and hem. Came with a horrible chemical smell but goes away quickly.Worth buying. Very sexy dress

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Hermos√≠simo, super√≥ lo que pens√© que me iba a llegar.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I purchased this for a Goddess party, definitely listen to other comments and size down. I am generally a medium but the medium size was sold out, I got a large and I was swimming in it, so returned it and got a small which fit better but was still quite long. I am 5'5 & 153 lbs with an athletic build. I think this dress would look stunning with heels and ofc add boob tape (my boobies tended to want to slip out the sides so I adjusted the strings to tie em down a bit!). Nice dress overall, hopefully I get the opportunity to wear it again.

  Very soft and stretchy gave my tush an amazing curve. Was afraid they would look cheap but they were a good material. He loved them.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  They fit nice and daddy loves them. They are not a cheap material like others

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ‚ô°'d the color, the words, the design, and the price.I did not ‚ô° the way they fit. They were way to small and I even ordered ONE SIZE BIGGER than I normally wear. I normally wear LARGE. I ordered an EXTRA-LARGE and it still was way to small.I DO NOT RECCOMEND & I WILL NOT BE BUYING THIS PRODUCT AGAIN!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This product fit like expected. Didn't shrink and was very breathable.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These fit really well. They look great and my boyfriend loves them. I've bought similar undies for a lot more that weren't as good as these. Love them!

  Comfy and they fit her extremely snugly in all the right places. Problem is they sent me the wrong pair. I go different writing other than what I ordered.

  Purchased this as birthday gift to myself and feeling like I needed to feel sexy again. Being plus size beauty now It is so difficult finding clothes but this item fit so well it even held my DDD breast nicely. Husband approved so I would definitely purchase again. Hope this helps my plus size ladies!

  It‚Äôs a tad big in some areas but I‚Äôm happy with it overall

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fit as expected for SHEIN sizing. The Large is probably most suitable for a 10 or 12- I'm a true 14 and it's a bit small.I'm a 36G and the cups were obviously far too small, but the band has plenty of stretch.STRONGLY recommend (if you have the capability to do so) to sew down the lace onto the elastic garter bands. The lace wants to roll up and that's not a good look on anyone... I used a honeycomb stitch to preserve the stretchiness and so far it's worked well.Not much to say about the panties, they're cute and not wedgie-prone.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this set. Adjustable and fits nicely on everyone! Wore a few times and still in decent shape. Lace is soft and nice design and cut. I love how it fits. I'm busty and this fits great. I got a small in the burgundy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The bra piece was a little small but my boobs are used to that. Fits as expected. Loved the product.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The color is beautiful! (Yellow) I loved how vibrant it looks. 34DDD is my bra size at Victoria Secret, so I got a large. My br East didn‚Äôt really fit or look right in the large but I‚Äôm 100% sure if you don‚Äôt have bigger br East this set will be perfect. Even better since it‚Äôs cheap too.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The lace is soft and its a perfect fit. I ordered the small. I'm a 34C and a 25 waist..5'6 130lbs.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I needed yellow swim suit or lingerie for a photoshoot and this was the only thing close to yellow that seemed flattering that I could find. Fit nice enough for what I needed it to do. I wouldn‚Äôt wear this bra under a shirt so I probably wouldn‚Äôt wear it unless showing off for a significant other.I am 5‚Äô6 about 140 lbs athletic built with 34C cup. Fit okay but if your a lot smaller it be too big. I had it on the tightest fitting around the body and it could have been much tighter. The harder belt is too loose to actually use with sock/stockings so it be more for just the look. But was worth what I paid for what I needed it for

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very dissatisfied, as soon as I  tried to put my leg through the panties the panties broke. I didn't even stretch them that much. Very bad quality sewing. The other side was hanging by a thread as well.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This product fits a little wonky. Half is too big, the other half is too small. The lace is nice though

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered a medium (normally a s/m at la senza in lingerie) and the bra band, and the garter are quite loose. I am normally a 34b. Little disappointed but still wearable.

  So I am 5‚Äô9 170lbs and normal wear a Large 8/10. Reading the mixed reviews I was very confused on which size to order but most of them say to order a smaller size so thats what I did. Not knowing which to order I took a chance on lucky number 7 and they fit perfectly. They look very plus size in the package but fit nicely. So my advice is to size down by 1 or 2 sizes.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These are fantastic. I got a size small I am 5‚Äô2 127 pounds. They are really cute and cheeky. I like that they aren‚Äôt tight on the waist line. They are actually pretty comfortable and sit well on my body. I have a flat belly and wide hips btw. Anyways love these and highly recommend. Me and my bf are long distance and I send A LOT of pics so these were a hit! Get them lol

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm not a heavy woman but I‚Äôm not stick thin either. These would work best for someone that is very thin without curves. The sides role at the top. But if you just put them on for a quick show they are very sexy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  They fit perfectly and are so comfortable!  And pretty - I have the bras to match (they are awesome too). So nice to find things my size that aren‚Äôt ugly lol. We heavy people deserve cute things tooüòÉ I‚Äôm buying more and tossing my old ones out. Yay

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I wear a size 12/14 in jeans. I bought the ""STANDARD"" size 10 in several colors and they are definitely plus size. I'm thinking the ""Standard"" are regular and the ""STANDARD"" are plus sizes. I know English is tough but if you don't want so many issues and crappy reviews, get a translator. I referenced a pair of undies from Target that are size large (not plus size large) if that helps. They feel nice, lace is soft, not scratchy. I wanted these to match my ""Smart & Sexy"" bralettes. I think they're with the trouble of trying to get the right size. I hope I'm right. I'll let y'all know.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These were a heavier lace than I was expecting, but they are so soft and comfortable. The only thing I didn't like at first is the little 'gem' at the front, but I have come to appreciate it in helping me determine front/back lol! It doesn't irritate at all and even looks kind of cute. I ordered the Size 9 and wear a size 18 pants - these fit perfectly.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  You know how lingerie sets all seem to come with those dinky g-strings?  I throw the g-strings out and wear a pair of these with my sexy lingerie.  To me they are much sexier. There are enough color choices to pair with most of my lingerie collection. They are cheeky and flattering on all body types. These fit true to size for me. Definitely a must buy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My husband requested that I get some sexy underwear. I was happy to oblige as I realized that I'd gotten pretty frumpy in the underwear department. I ordered a size 10 and they were too big. I probably need a size down or even 2 sizes down. Unfortunately those were unavailable in the black and blue set that I was hoping to get. (For reference I wear a size 8 in lululemon wonder under leggings- that's the best reference size I have at the moment.) I can't quite say how comfortable they were since they didn't really fit. My impression was that they weren't going to be amazingly comfortable, but that they would be comfortable enough. The quality seemed on par for the price point.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So I read the comments before buying this underwear. At first glance, it definitely looks very big, until you put it on. I think it‚Äôs cute, however I am 5,9 and way around 175. I went with a size 7, which ended up being a tad too small. I am normally a size 9 in jeans, and I think a size 9 would fit perfectly.In the front of the underwear curves a bit low  towards your private, and it does the Samething in the back but curves towards your butt instead. If this doesn‚Äôt bother you, then you will probably enjoy this underwear ‚ò∫Ô∏è I would recommend going with your jean size.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I wasn‚Äôt sure what size to order so I picked my regular size. It told me based on previous orders I‚Äôve made, a smaller size would fit me best. I thought that was great because I would‚Äôve ordered 3 sizes bigger! I‚Äôm a 10 and it said to order 7.  These fit perfect! They look so good on. Something I didn‚Äôt notice when I ordered, there‚Äôs a little jewel on the front which is really cute. I got a two-pack. I‚Äôm definitely going to order more now. Can‚Äôt wait for the matching bralette to arrive!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I have fallen in love with this underwear brand. I have nothing bad to say except I wish there were more choices in style and colour and/or mix and match sets.  I live in canada and they are a US based company but do not ship to canada - otherwise I would order off their website. Im hoping Amazon Canada will be able to supply more styles (for example: I found a bra I like, but cant find matching underwear in the same colour). Other than that, they are great.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love these panties they are very comfortable and fit perfectly I got the size 6 as I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 weigh 126lbs. Fast shipping & fast delivery I will be purchasing more of these panties! Thank you!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The quality of these are decent and the colours are superb. I wish there was a size guide. I ordered a size 8 on the off chance that it was like pants sizes. It looks more like a size 18.

  Material is good but size is not for petit girls, some parts fit and others don't at all.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My wife looks super adorable in it, pros: it‚Äôs really soft and by her own admission comfortable as all hell. The downside is the headband keeps slipping off.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The top was a little snug on my boobs I have very large boobs so that‚Äôs normal for things to be snug in the bottoms can honestly fit anyone the tail is pinned on by safety pen which I didn‚Äôt think was too smart and it‚Äôs a little dangerous in my opinion but overall it‚Äôs very cute and I like it my boyfriend does too

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The top is WAYYY to big if you don‚Äôt have a lot in that department. Also it‚Äôs pretty cheaply made you can drill see strings hanging off it from whoever made it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super cute outfit. My fiance and I love it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Loved it!!! Fits perfectly ü§ó

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Pictures are accurate. Cute and fits well , quality is what you would expect for the price

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It was just not tight enough around the bust area to get the look on the model. Other than that came exactly as the picture shows

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  for the price you would expect it yo be better... the pink ribbons are very fragile and when i got it the bra hole was off center, the fabric is good quality if that means anything to you, the bra has elastics in it witch are enough to hold it in please for me so you could probs save it if you have this issue by just cutting them off but again for the price (30cad) this shouldn't be a issue

  I absolutely love this and it fits me perfectly! My husband went crazy! Must buy ladies!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This was completely perfect for the price. The package contained everything but stockings. I took the choker off just because that wasn‚Äôt the vibe I was going for. The lace obviously is cheap, so I‚Äôm hesitant to just throw it in the washer. The thick straps that surround the lace are all elastic and VERY comfortable. When I put this set on, i didn‚Äôt have to undo anything. I slipped right in to it. I‚Äôm also not very thick, but this set DEFINITELY gives you shape.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am an exotic dancer so any piece of clothing has to be flattering, fit comfortably, and have stretch enough to where I can move and Shake. I'm not saying that this is one of my favorite outfits, but what I will say is I make some pretty good money in this! I am 5' 2"" and around 190lbs. The XL fits well and stretches enough to fit a was of ones.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This set is flattering and true to size. I ordered size Large and I'm 5'5"", about 170lbs and 36DD. As you can see I have a little bit of a roll situation on my sides and back, so if you do as well the bottom harness strap can unfortunately accentuate that, but the material is very comfortable. I feel that going the next size up would have made the bottoms too loose but that's just my particular body shape. I recommend this set regardless, it's so sexy and will have you feeling hot!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  True to size, I got a large for comfort and stretch..

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fit me perfect!  I got a small I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 curvy around 130-140. Top fit very nice, I was nervous when I saw the bottoms because they didn‚Äôt have much stretch and I have a big butt but they fit and were very flattering.Really nice structure and quality!! True to size!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am a large bottom and 34A bra.  I can not fit in a med bottom so I got the large set hoping for the best.  I am actually very happy with the overall fit!! With the hook and loops on the smallest setting the top fits just fine.  There is room for a larger chest but still looks flattering on my lil girls lol! The. Only piece that looked to big was the removable choker and it still looked acceptable.  I highly recommend this set! For the price it‚Äôs worth it!!!‚Äô

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I don‚Äôt normally write reviews, but clothes - especially lingerie - always benefit from reviews. So if you‚Äôre thinking about buying this item, do it!! The idea of $15 lingerie made me skeptical too, but I decided to give it a try after reading all the other positive reviews, and it is so worth it!The quality of this item is really nice, and I love that almost everything is adjustable (the chocker, the bralette, and the garter belt all have hook and eye clasps). Some of the straps on the bralette are a little loose, but that‚Äôs easily fixed with some minor tailoring.I ordered an XXL, despite normally wearing an XL, because I‚Äôm 6‚Äô5‚Äù and have learned the hard way that I need to order lingerie a size up to account for the length of my legs and torso. Overall, this is a great item and well worth the money; I highly recommend it!!

  My wife tried this on and instantly asked me to clip the tags off, before even looking in the mirror or trying on a top over it. She's been looking for a good racerback bra to wear with racerback tank tops, and this one was an instant favorite for fit, shape and secure full coverage.She's 5'7"", 151 lbs, 36DD, 40-29-40, 55 years old. The band is non-adjustable but has some stretch, and she liked the fit. Her underbust / band size, measured without a bra on, is 32.5"".You can see from the first photo that there's no gapping with the straps, unlike even her favorite standard bra. There's also no push-up effect, but it does have a plunging design that can support deep V-neck tops and dresses. The bra conforms well to her natural shape, but there's less forward projection than with some other bras. The bra is nice enough to wear with a dress, while still being secure and supportive enough for athletic activity. The second photo shows the bra under a stretch tank top.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This bra has good support and just enough padding to keep everything smooth underneath clingy t-shirts. The front clasp is easy to work and the cut is perfect for tanks and other sleeveless attire. It's well made and the underwire channel is solidly constructed; I don't see it ripping or tearing for the dreaded exposed wire. I really like this bra in terms of comfort and construction.Here's the problem: The fit is really off. I am a standard 38D in just about every bra brand, and that's not a loose 38--it's a 38 at the tightest hook; I'm probably between a 36 and a 38. The 38 band in this bra is SNUG. If you're on the loose end of a 38, definitely size up a band or two.Second, I am a standard D cup in most bra brands‚Äîno spillage. I sized up to a 38DD because of the shape of the cup and the comments of another reviewer. Even in a DD cup, there is a LOT of spillage. I loosened the straps to the longest length to relieve some of the overflow and decrease the pushup effect, which I absolutely don't want or need, and that helped quite a bit, but there's still overflow to the point of near uniboob effect. I'm keeping the bra because I can make it work and I won't wear it with deeper cut tops, and I really wanted a black bra to wear with my tank tops and dresses. But be aware that you will need to size up, at least if you are in the larger cup sizes. And definitely watch your band size carefully or it will be uncomfortably snug and there is no adjusting that with a front closure bra.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is the most comfortable regular bra I have ever put on. It's perfect. I was worried about the racerback straps hurting my neck muscles like some racerback sports bras I've worn, but they are cut just right. They don't put any pressure on my neck at all! I don't feel constricted by it either.Also, whatever band size you are, size up. I was skeptical, but so many reviews advised it I just went for it. I'm so glad I did, it's a PERFECT fit. If I had gone with my regular band size, it would have been tight. Remember,  cup size is relative to band size, so whatever cup size you are, you are a size smaller when you go up a band size. For example, I am a 34DD, and ordered a 36D and it's just right.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My problems before this bra:narrow shoulders, sore back, trigger finger (yes really - tendon related), beginning to get difficult to connect back closing bras.IF you are going from a back closing bra to a T-back or Racer back bra then you will probably need to change size as well.I was a 34D. I fit this as a 34DD.If your band size is comfortable at the smallest length,(the closure furthest in leaving 2 hanging over (not used)) then stick with your current band size. IF you are on the last eyelet with no room to expand go up another band size.If you fit well at D then go up to DD. Hope that helps. If you're use to racer backs and know your size with them then stick with it.It has a thin pad layer for no grocery store freezer mishaps. ;0This is my Favorite bra!!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I wore this bra one time. I was at a fair with lots of people around, and ten minutes in, the freaking bra snapped! It snapped at the front clasp so I had to walk around the fair the rest of day with my arms crossed. Very disappointed.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  After reading all the good reviews on this bra, I decided to try one. Sure enough, it's very comfortable.Fits me perfectly. The racerback, but embellished design makes it look great from all angles. Trusted brand, too.I wore this under a partially see-through black bodycon dress on a date with an old work acquaintance. However,late that afternoon before the date, I was having second thoughts about the bra. Its clasp is made of thin plastic.But, as comfortable as this bra is, I decided just not to worry about it. Around 7PM things somehow got a littletoo boring for the gentleman, a retired engineer, and he was falling asleep. So, I pulled the dress down a little bit to get his thoughts about the clasp thinking this would definitely wake him up. He exclaimed ""It won't last the night!"" and then promptly fell soundly asleep. Other tactics got him roused, but the bra stayed on the entire date. He was wrong. I took the photo with me in it a few minutes before midnight, after he took me home. It shows that the clasp held despite my fears. I'm small busted, so I'm not sure how the plastic would hold up for a woman with the typically larger bust. But, given the relatively low cost and all the other good things about it -for mepersonally, it's 5 stars.  I'm 5'7"", 140, 36B.-Sina

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was not happy that this bra arrived with dirty marks on it.  I finally decided I would wash it rather than return it so I hope the marks will come off.  I was very glad to find this as I have purchased similar ones in the US but find front opening bras difficult to obtain in the UK.  Not sure why as they make much more sense!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Im a standard 34B and this is far too small.No where near true to size and is not fitting around my bak,. very strange back.  Requested return but  postage costs more than garent, total waste of money.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Sizing is completely off, comes from America so postage is expensive if you want to return.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fabulously comfortable - only issue is the ribbon holding the fastening clasp in place isn't as good as it should be. Needs to be re-assessed by manufacturer.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits much better than I expected (from previous experience of front-fastening bras). The catch takes a bit of getting used to, but once you've got it, it's easy.

  Fits great but after one wash the top was completely destroyed and ultimately unwearable. Thankfully Amazon had a super easy to use exchange policy and I had a new set within 2 days!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The cups on the bra are beyond tiny. I ordered a large and wear 38D, and the band fits fine but it doesn't even cover to my nipples. While I'm not exactly trying to hide those, it is not an attractive look having it cut lower than that.The thong has adjustable sides, which means it fits pretty much anyone.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Feel like I was swindled. This is from SHEIN and is way cheeper there. Also-the tag was sewn into the elastic waist band so you couldn‚Äôt take it out

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Yeah...no one these boobs will fit in this haha

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Its an odd fit. Im in between small and medium i ordered medium for this item and glad i did. The underwear fits like a xs/small the bra is on the larger end. Love this piece tho even if its not good for long term use.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This set fit beautifully, I love adjustable straps. The bottoms are perfectly fit anybody size. I wish the flowers would‚Äôve been attached a little bit better, I lost two flowers the first day wearing it. But this is one of my favorite sets

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very flimsy. The bra part of the set has no structure and is way too stretchy to the point that the underwire won‚Äôt fit snugly against the rib cage like it‚Äôs supposed to. I don‚Äôt even have a large chest but it just rides up in a weird way and is completely unwearable. So sad because the style and fabric is really cute

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this set. The bra fit perfect, I‚Äôm a 36D and got a Large but the only thing that made me sad was the bottoms. They were extremely small, however the bra??? my boyfriend loved it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I wear a 32c in most bras and the cups on this one were way too small. It seems to be made for no larger than a 32a sized cup but the band was still loose on the smallest hook. it's a cute design but poor quality fabric and weird sizing.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Tr√®s agr√©able a la vuequalit√©/prix ok

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Cups too small for band size. i have a small chest and i couldnt even fit the bottom half of my boobs... also its not as cute in person :/

  It took two tries to get the size right, the material feels amazing super soft non clinging doesn't make you hot at night. But if you are a large in US size you need an extra extra large in Asian size.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered this item in leopard print, black, red, and green. The solid colors are made of a ribbed, almost lycra/nylon feeling material that keeps me cool at night in bed. However, for some reason, this animal print one is made of a completely different material. It feels like a weird cotton and spandex blend, and it traps heat like crazy. Why aren't the fabrics the same? I would have liked to have known this prior to ordering it. Ugh.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is cute, but a little shorter than I expected. My bf likes it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am a size 14-16, roughly about 215lbs, 5'5"". I went by their posted size chart. Of course I ordered the XL (according to the seller it's size 16-18.) Lol.....ummmm no way! It was tight and extremely short, barely passing my lady part. The material feels like soft and silky, but very thin and see through. It kinda looks like a cheap basketball jersey. If u do decide to buy this, absolutely size up 1-2 sizes. Happy Shopping:)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The large is a little too small and fits like a men's tank. The fabric is stretchy but a little too sheer. There are better options out there!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This not a cotton sleep shirt. The material isn't so bad but its really small, I even went up a size. It's like a tank top which I wanted just hoping it would actual cover my butt and not just reach the middle of it. I did not return it cause it was cheap

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love it. It's simple yet kinda flirty and sexy

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Makes you look thinner too!  A little snug so I would suggest to go up a size.

  This is probably one of my faves from Avid Love & I probably have about 8 pieces from their company. Size large fits US size 10/12 (38D) perfectly, and it provides just enough support to be a fantastic presentation! I'll definitely be buying more in other colors, and hope they start offering more lingerie with nip-nop holes.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I secretly ordered this for my wife on her account. Needless to say it was a surprise when she got the package, but it was a better surprise for me to see her in it. This was icing on the cake. I don‚Äôt know much about lingerie, but this piece looks really good.

  This slip has gorgeous lace.  The fabric is slinky, soft, and stretchy.  Clothes easily slide over it.  The skin sensation is luxurious as it hugs my body.  The straps are a little thin and the metal strap adjustment hardware is on the cheesy side. I don‚Äôt know why I am always confused about how to put on dresses and slips with crossed back straps, it usually takes me a couple of tries to get my head and arms through the right holes. The slip is form fitting in the chest and waist then flairs to a tent size at the knees. The side seams are a bit scratchy on my stomach and there is a huge stiff hang tag, size tag and name tag stacked, folded, and stitched into the side seam near the left side vent, ugh.  Maybe it will soften up after a few washings as it appears I would have to cut the side seam stitches to remove it.  Vents on both sides are 4-1/2‚Äô long. Fabric was wrinkled in the package but after ironing it has stayed relatively wrinkle free.Fit: I ordered the XL based on the size chart in the photos. It fits me as expected from the chart, the bust is correct and the hips are too large on me as my bust and hips are roughly the same size while the slip has a larger hip size than bust.  Even though I am tall, the length is good landing a little above my knees. Many things are too short for my height. With the strap adjusted to near max the length measured around 35 inches.  For reference I am 40/36/39, 6‚Äô tall and 187 pounds.Constructions: sewing is well done.  All seams are attached and there are no thread tails hanging out.  The lace is well attached with a strong stretch overlock stitch.Overall: above average slip; well made, fits well, has beautiful lace, and works as it should.  I would buy again.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This night dress is super sexy and comfortable perfect for sleeping. It fits perfectly and is super breathable and stretchy. The lace is made of high quality material that will last. The back has a nice cross design and open slit on the hips. Super attractive and sexy. This works perfectly for my Valentine's night at home. It is a great attractive shape with lots of room for plus size body's. Buy this if you want to be sexy and comfortable.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  soft, comfortable material..Stretchy which is a good thing because the material is clingy and tight-fitting so it shows any body flaws.  I the material is very soft and the lace is good quality.  The straps are sturdy and well constructed,  I'm not generally a light blue kind of person but  the color is warm and appealing.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My wife‚Äôs review: I am 127 lbs, 36B and ordered size medium in the nude color. It fits well, not super loose, but just right. It is well made and pretty. It works well under my long dresses. It washed well on gentle cycle and I hung it to dry.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The nightgown looks good and wears very comfortable. A little bit long. I normally wear a 4-6 size and the Medium size fits me perfectly. Love it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It fits just right. I ordered a medium. Its comfortable and a little sexy. I'm definitely buying another!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Vlazom Women Nightgown Sexy Lingerie Full Slip Under Dress Soft Lace Nightshirts is very soft, and yes, sexy. It doesn't have a lot of support if one is larger up top. The criss cross back looks great once it's on but can be fun to attempt to actually get my arms in the right openings. The nightgown is actually well made, with adjustable straps

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love the quality of this nightdress, it's so soft and feels very expensive.  I have a large chest and usually have a problem with straps falling down through the night and can be very uncomfortable. This nightdress has criss/cross straps which makes it a lot more comfortable for me. It's a great length too. I bought the beige colour first and loved it that much that I've bought it in all colours. More colours please! Highly recommend.

  Nice material but nightdress is wider at the top than the bottom so fit my hips but drowned me up top! Would fit a very large chested lady well

  Ordered: SmallMeasurements: 34,27,38I‚Äôm Surprised! Finding sexy, fitted but forgiving, without looking overly cheap or falling apart after one wear can be a challenge. But, this set manages all those needs nicely. All pieces have a little stretch that should be considered when determining how fitted/smooth you want the garment under your clothing. The top is a standard double hook bra closure with three options to increase length. Shoulder straps are adjustable. The top is a welcome enhancement that accents (even someone without a full breast). The bra cups offer light shape and support. I typically wear a C cup. For those a little more rambunctious- I bounced up/down and hung upside. The girls remained nicely contained in their respective cups. üôÇ No spillage or readjustment needed. The g -string is standard single, slide-able strap up the ass. I find it inline with other panties of this nature. The garter belt has an apx 6 in (top to bottom), 3 row hook and eye closure. The garter straps are adjustable with classic stocking attachments that push through and slide to trap and lock your stockings in place. All hardware is gold. For the item I received, the stocking hardware is slightly discolor- the metal quality isn‚Äôt super phenomenal so with that in mind, I‚Äôll end up sealing them al with my handy-dandy clear, car topcoat touch up pen, to extend the life of the outfit a little longer.Summary:  For the price... well worth it.I‚Äôve already ordered more colors. üôÇ

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was so satisfied with this set! The straps are adjustable so I was able to get the perfect fit. I have 40DDDs and ordered the XXL!! It‚Äôs so sexy and feels very sturdy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It fit great and covered my tummy which is what I love but still feeling sexy. Good purchase!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5'2 and 124 lbs and ordered a size small. Fits perfect, looks amazing, and the material is comfortable too.

  Fits perfectly. Details are so beautiful. Ive gotten compliments on how it looks. Doesn‚Äôt feel as delicate and fragile as other lingerie I‚Äôve gotten

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was so impressed with the quality of this set given the price! The material feels sturdy and is soft to the touch, with beautiful detailing on the lace. I ordered a size small and was surprised that every piece of the set fit me so well! The garter belt is high waisted and so flattering. I‚Äôve never worn a lingerie top like this but was pleasantly surprised with how good it looks on! Hugged my curves beautifully. This set is definitely worth it for the price and is much better quality than any other lingerie I‚Äôve ordered on amazon. Absolutely in love!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I hate it. I buy lots of lingerie and this is one I will never wear. The top has zero support, which is normally fine but this makes my boobs look weird and just...sad. The garter is very wide/tall and makes my mid section look bigger than it is which is the last thing you want in lingerie. The thing is ok I guess. The material is not nice to boot! I have gotten a ton of cheap stuff off amazon but it is always soft and nice. This was scratchy and uncomfortable. It looks and feels like horrible, cheap, garbage.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This set is super cute and super comfortable, I do recommend this for people looking for lingerie that‚Äôs sexy but also ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. It has some stretch so it will fit, I bought a 3XL, the largest size. I‚Äôm a little disappointed that the straps ripped like this, I typically never have to readjust the straps to any bra or bralette. I wasn‚Äôt being rough with the bra either I was pulling on it to clip it together but nothing crazy. It‚Äôs a little inconvenient that I have to go in and sew it but I‚Äôm not too mad, I would say be careful and make the straps looser before you put the bra on to avoid any problems. Other than that, you need this set!

  ¬†Bomb.comStretchy comfortable material. Just prefect. I saw the same one on fashionnova for double the price.Got a size 2x

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I feel so comfortable and sexy

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this set a lot it‚Äôs my first lingerie cute, sexy , simple and really comfortable. My boyfriend loved it!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is super cute! It‚Äôs comfortable and the material is soft, doesn‚Äôt seem too flimsy. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 and weigh 155. I ordered a medium and it‚Äôs fit pretty well! I have a smaller chest and not a lot of curves but this set is still so flattering and so cute. I have been telling all my friends to get the same one!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bought this for a cute Halloween costume. It fit perfectly and was very comfortable. Some edges weren‚Äôt perfectly finished, and I had to cut a couple loose threads. But otherwise fantastic

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Usually I‚Äôm an xs or a small. I got a size small and it fits well. The bra & underwear straps are really stretchy and a little baggy when I lay down.Overall this set is perfect for photos and cute and pretty comfortable if you‚Äôre looking for something to take photos in.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This set was gorgeous. I‚Äôm not sure how to wear the garters so I don‚Äôt but it looks amazing without it. The top fit REALLY well, lots of stretch in the straps and band area below the boobs. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like is the underwear feel like they‚Äôre a size bigger? If that makes sense. So I don‚Äôt wear them. But they‚Äôre cute

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 140lbs, and wear a 34B and I ordered a Medium! The top fits just right, the bottoms could be a little more snug but they still fit! Super nice set for a great price!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It looks great on, but won't last long a long time. But if you want something to wear that will blow his socks off, this will do the trick!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very Sexy, bright colour. The bottom were too big for me needed adjusting. But overall very nice lingerie!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Loved these sets and so did my hubby, good quality and very sexy!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I felt so sexy in this and my partner loved it, the thong is very thin and definitely cuts you up a bit but to be fair, that doesn‚Äôt stay on too long once your partner see you in this, great value and the little heart details were so unbelievably cute! Very happy overall

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  What normally puts me off wearing lingerie is the discomfort. This set is incredibly sort and light with no wires or hard bits to poke at your skin. You could comfortably wear this set all day.I will say that if you have a larger chest and are looking for a good bit of support from your lingerie, this may not be the set for you. Similarly, the back clasps are not adjustable, so if you‚Äôre very very slim it may not fit well either (I normally wear a 36 bra band and it‚Äôs just about small enough for me - any larger and it would be too loose).

  I wish I could write every review with photos but this is definitely one of them that you can‚Äôt post photos for.This fits really well! The clip doesn‚Äôt dig into your back and the size is spot on at 110 pounds 5 foot six I am a small with B sized breasts.It‚Äôs definitely best made for women with small wastes for sure as it really has a good fit in extending the look of my legs! Worth it - same quality as vs or foh.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The waist band of the garter is pretty small, then there's the thong. If you are super tall and thin.. this is for you. What a weird fit. The bra has a very tiny band and cups bit has straps on each side of the breast that are huge. I'm 5'5 125lbs 25 inch waist 32 d . It is almost like I was sent 3 different sized pieces

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My only BIG dislike about this product was the garter belt! It kept flipping and shifting around and the straps were barely long enough to reach my kneee high socks. that claps on the straps are also pretty flimsy & small so they were kinda difficult to get attached to socks. Although the belt wasn‚Äôt the best the panties & bra fit very nice! not a too tight! They both have super cute details on them & look rlly good!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is really pretty! I‚Äôm large chested, so I always wish that lingerie tops had more support, but I know that they don‚Äôt, so I‚Äôm not disappointed. I have no butt, so the thing is a little big, but I can work with it. Overall, this is a great set.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I liked this set, for the price. The bra had another strap on it, but it hung off stupid and provided 0 support. Actually, when I cut it off it sat better on me. The girls stay in place even with brisk exercise. The fabric isn't the best, but also not the worst. Its comfortable enough for me to sleep in. The edge on the bra along the band digs in a little, I'm 120ish pounds and a size 4, I ordered the 4-6, used size chart, it fits fine enough.The garter is awesome and also terrible. The clasps are cheap metal (if you can call it that, its like some metallic like resin or some alloy mixture thats cheap and weak) and the plastic is too firm for my liking. Its tail is also too slender causing the plastic bits to pop off easily before being slid into place. The sew job is solid in terms of strength, but you can easily see the stitching through the front and it isn't evenly stitched. I don't think it'll rip, but the clasps have got to go. Straps on garter are also longer than necessary in the front. Thats why I don't have pictures of it yet. I will modify it and possibly update on here with the result. The underwear is cute and relatively comfortable for being a cheap thong.My honest opinion is its good for the price, I figured I would have to modify it a little when I bought it so I'm still happy with what I got. It fit correctly based on the size chart, just make sure and measure yourself. Don't expect this to be high quality either, I would say its about walmart level in terms of quality. Its a nice, cheap set that feels okay and looks cute. I recommend at 12$ for the set.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love this is perfect and priced well! Looks good on and isn‚Äôt cheap material it‚Äôs good !

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Lingerie on Amazon? It was affordable, so I gave it a try. Stretch and fit are good, true American plus sizes~ I'm smaller up top and bigger at the bottom, but thick and round all around, and this set fit great and looked so nice. Definitely something to wear for looking at though, I would not recommend attempting to wear them out and about in public for whatever compelling reasons. If you use them to look sexy and feel sexy, then by that standard, they are very comfortable.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great product- it‚Äôs comfortable and affordable. It‚Äôs very durable and flattering for the price range!

  Absolutely digusting! Recieved this item in the mail, went to open up the package and try it on and it has clearly already been worn before! There was white discharge or something at the buttons of the bodysuit where the crotch is. So gross and so disappointed that this item wasnt checked thoroughly it was obviously a returned item i recieved.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs perfect.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äù3117lb302436A bit hard to get over my hips but other than that fit like a glove

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Okay so I got this as a back up to wear for my birthday event, and now i‚Äôm actually going to wear it. Im 5‚Äô3‚Äù 120lbs (athletic build). Usually a size xs/s in tops and 00/24 in bottoms. Then there‚Äôs the chest lol. Im around a size 36C/32DD I don‚Äôt really know I never wear real bras. But I got a small. If I got a medium it would‚Äôve been too big but the small is a tiny bit small in the chest but all other areas fits perfect. I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve liked the way it fit as a medium.BUY THIS! You won‚Äôt regret it!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Loved this body suit it is super sexy!! My only dislike was that the wire came out the first day i got it! So i ended up removing them both and actually liked it more without it. Im 125lbs and ordered a medium, it fit just right!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'0"", 130 lbs, 37"" bust (34DDD), 27.5"" waist and 37"" hips and I ordered a size medium and it fit perfectly on my body but too small in the bust area. I then ordered a large and was still too small on the bust area and was saggy on the butt area. I believe this would be true to size in the bust area if I ordered an XL which they are out of stock at the moment. I plan on ordering more colors in XL. Fabric is good material as well. Also using fabric tape helped to keep the girls in place.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I purchased this body suit to wear to a concert and didn‚Äôt think I would ever wear it again, but I was PLEASANTLY shocked with how amazing it turned out. I have a larger bust but a smaller waist so I ordered a small, the fit was perfect. The straps adjust really well and everyone LOVED my outfit and asked where I ordered and so funny that I sent them to amazon. I highly recommend this purchase. Very great packaging as well.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5,1"" and 129 lbs and I got a S size. It looked weird around the bust area, kinda small there. So I decided to take the wires out and that made it look just right. I like the shape and fabric, it doesn't look cheap.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Here are my stats:I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 ... between 190-200lbs & 38DD boobs. I got a XL because I wanted my boobs go fit. Although I will try a L because this was a little looser than I like. But overall the fit was PERFECT üëåüèæI love love loved the top. I got so many compliments. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because the underwire came out 6 hours into the bodysuit! By the end of the night I couldn‚Äôt take the poking so I took it out all together. That was a bummer. If you have some sewing skills this could easily be fixed but I can‚Äôt be bothered.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I dont like it at all. The cups will not fit the breast. It looks all wong on. I am big bust and i bought the right size. I have to wear a bathing suit top with it just to make it look a bit normal to wear.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Me encanto! Por ahora soy talla 12 us y mido 1.75 metros, me quedo bien el xl. Estiliza la figura, parece de menos calidad cuando abres el paquete pero luce lindo, lo √∫nico es que yo siempre batallo con el cierre de abajo por mi altura, no me cierra pero a√∫n as√≠ me lo puse

  La tela genial, super suave. Muy comoda

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I like this set of PJs a lot! The price is so much better than you'd find at department stores and they really look great on!I looked at pictures and read reviews and must have missed this: the back is open - it has two pieces of fabric that overlap but aren't sewn together. Based on the pictures, I thought it was just a slit. I wish I had known this when I chose a size. - I probably would have ordered the Medium instead of the Large. I worried the top would be too snug but the open back gave it way more room than I thought there would be!I ordered a Large and they fit but are on the bigger size. I'm 5' 7"", 155#, athletic build, 34C/D. The shorts are quite short (though it's fine, that's the point on these, right?). The straps on the top are adjustable which is great!The only bizarre thing about my set was that the tag of the shorts was partially cut off - as though someone bought my pair and returned them (see pic). I didn't notice until I had worn and washed them and was putting them away so I just dealt with it but it grossed me about a bit to think I received used lingerie.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So I got this for my wife, she has a very nice body, and loves nice soft things like this to wear to bed, she is thick in the backside, slim waist, but it fits a little odd. She says she likes it but I have yet to see her wear it and told her to send it back and find something she thinks will be a better fit. Let's just say it seems to fit a particular type of body better, more of a thin from head to toe, my wife has a beautiful body, but this is made for someone with not much in the trunk and wasn't the most flattering. I think she look great in everything but it was even confusing for a minute to get it in right. I'm not saying it's a bad item, it's really nice, very soft, but if you try it and it's not for your body type just return it. Otherwise it seems like a very nice product. No complaints, it just doesn't fit my wife the way she likes.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  They fit great. Usually wear a medium waist and medium/large top, but purchased a large for a little extra room/comfort. Would have been fine with a medium, just more exposed and little more restricted. I'm 5'7"" and about 140lbs for reference. This was cheeky enough to be playful, but still cover enough to tease. The top fit well, covered up enough, but allows... easy access if needed.The feel of these are great they are soft and silky and contracted fairly well.It was a pretty big hit with my husband too!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this brands items - however. I'd washed the set before wearing and rinsed dozens of times. IF YOU GET THE DARKER sets WASH AT LEAST 10 times by hand before wearing! It seriously took me that many times to get the water to run clear. What ever happened to 'color fast' fabric??? It RUINED my $100 sheets! Stained my tub (Where I hang dry). The pic is of my sheets. :(

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bought this one without expect much since Chinese manufactured clothes always have some negative points but omg... this one is flawless. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 200lbs, ordered XL and fits perfect. The shorts is lifted up a bit in the back, making your butt looks extra cute. Love the little details of black slit on the top. Stretchy materials so very comfortable. Would buy it again in different colors

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fact: I hate overly enthusiastic reviews.Also fact: This set is now the most favorite jam-jams I own. They‚Äôre comfortable, cute, low key sexy, and flattering for my athletic build. They might be too risqu√© for when the in-laws are visiting though. For the price, the quality exceeded my expectations. I was expecting scratchy cheap satin. What I got was soft and stretchy, and I feel glorious wearing them.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love how soft and comfortable this is. But if you‚Äôre looking for sexy then size down. I‚Äôm usually a large, 5‚Äô3, 150. But in this I should have ordered a medium. The top ties so it would have looked more flattering with a smaller top and the shorts are a bit too big for me and do not hug my butt like I would like them too. So make sure you size down ladies.

  I ordered both a large and a medium as I wasn‚Äôt sure how they were going to fit. I ended up liking the fit of the medium much better; however, the medium arrived damaged. Right between the breast the stitching had come undone. I ended up sending it back and the replacement arrived in perfect condition. The material is very soft and flows. The color is true to the pictures.34D with 30‚Äù waist for reference

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Perfect fit

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I like to wear cute comfy night gowns. This one is my new favorite. It came earlier than expected,  excellent condition,  and great quality.  It came with a matching thong. The breast area is not push up it is lined with lace,  but there is a seam underneath your breast and the straps are adjustable so it is flattering.  I bought the small.  I am 5'6"" Victoria secret 32C and about 135lbs. I love the red color and the fabric is veryyyy soft!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bought this set for a boudoir shoot. It was honestly the best decision.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 around 110 pounds.  It‚Äôs sexy and comfortable.  I really like the detail on the back!  Soft, stretchy material is very cling and shows the outline of everything (panties, hipbones).

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fit as expected, go up one side.  I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù195 lbs usually a size 14 ordered a XL. Good quality, fast shipping, totally worth it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Came a bit wrinkled (which I expected), but AMAZING! it's comfortable and sexy, the light, flexible material clings to your body in all the right ways!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Loved, perfect for some boudoir pictures!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is a nice piece! My hubby liked it on me. I got navy blue very soft fabric. Adjustable straps help keep the girls in but not totally secure enough for sleeping. Good buy for the price washes well

  It‚Äôs a smaller fit to other styles

  This was a hit. If you are not the ""sexy lacey lady"" type this is the piece for you. I bought this in grey, XL. I'm 5'7 around 180lb. This item falls just right. It wasn't tight so I felt comfy but still got the desired attention. You may even want to go a size down for a closer fit. The material is tshirt soft. You will forget you're wearing lingerie...but your SO will not.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is my second of these chemists and I absolutely love them - I want one in every color! They are super cute & sexy, flattering, and incredibly soft & comfortable all at the same time! I love the adjustable straps (I have a slight scoliosis so one of my shoulders sits a bit lower than the other) and the short length - I'm only 5"" tall and it's really hard finding nightgowns that don't come down to my knees. I bought a small and it's definitely true to size. I will definitely be buying more from this brand!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I loved this night gown. It was sexy, yet very comfy. It is super soft as well. I'm 5'1 175 ps and I ordered a large due to my breast size, and it fits great. I probably could have sized down though. I love the adjustable straps and the way that is flows. I'll definitely be ordering more of these.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very soft and sexy. What a win... sexy nighties are never comfortable. Love the green color! I normally wear a medium, but followed advice on other reviews and purchased a large... it could be a bit smaller, but I see how a medium may have been too small. I‚Äôm happy with the large fit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It looks better then I expected feels so soft and comfy when wearing it. Its prime so shipping came fast. I'm plus size an normally wear size 14 pants or 1x I ordered extra large hoping it would fit right and its perfect. It doesn't have cups for your chest area which is what I was looking for because I'm extremely top heavy and cups make me fall out. I just ordered two other colors dark grey and dark green cant wait for them to come. Will be wearing these alot to bed üòä

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I used to sleep in tanks or tees, I‚Äôd rather sleep in this every night, it‚Äôs so comfortable! So flattering, and so soft! I want 10 more!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was looking for some comfortable nightgowns that were super soft and I had no idea what material that was. I took a risk but I LOVE THESE. I got the black and the red, they are the slinky type of material that hugs your curves but is not tight at all, it is super comfy. The straps are fully adjustable which is a plus for girls like me with a short torso. I am also very slim, 34-24-36 and it fit me nicely, not in the waist of course, a bit big but overall looks great and feels great I am super satisfied.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I almost bought a medium because that's my normal size but I'm so glad I sized up. This little number is super short! But made me feel super feminine and sexy! My husband loved it (this is his account lol). For reference I'm 5'7"", 145lbs and tall/athletic build. The straps are adjustable which I really liked too.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Nice fit, nice look and nice feel to fabric, but lace strap has already come away on the back and only worn 5 times.  I will need to re attach to be able to wear again.  I imagine this might be a problem with this style

  This robe is so sexy. Better than I expected.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The evening was right and the mood was right.  The gown was little thin but it‚Äôs good for the bucks. She thought I went to the xxx store.  Nope prime baby prime.  Ty amazon

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Right off the bat, this item is cheap so it's not going to be amazing quality. It's certainly not bad, though! I've bought my fair share of cheap items and this one is very acceptable. The lace is not stiff or scratchy and the ""satin"" bits are nice and smooth. I had worried that those bits might feel kinda paper-y, especially the belt, but they were actually quite nice and soft! I feel like I can't justify giving a full 5-star rating because it is still a low end item, but I would still very much recommend buying it! There's nothing wrong with it, it's just not luxurious. Definitely worth the money and I'd say it fulfilled my needs. The only minor complaint I have, and maybe this is just me, but it does somewhat slide open. I guess if you close it ""tightly"" by overlapping the sides a lot it might be better but as I was going for a more titillatingly sexy look with lingerie underneath I chose to wear it a little loose, and consequently the top part would slide open a little bit. Still, good item overall, I am pleased with my purchase.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very flattering shape, softer lace, gave me more confidence in wearing lingerie.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought this and a few other inexpensive lingerie items for a boudoir shoot that didn't happen because of coronavirus. The robe barely fits over my breasts (5'2"", 121 lbs, curvy and short-waisted but large-busted - 34DD - I bought Medium). I did not bother trying on the accompanying g-string as those rarely fit me or look good anyway. I will use my own black thong or g-string to go with it. It does seem to be quite delicate, and it could tear or rip pretty easily. I am a little afraid to wash it but will hand wash in the sink and see how that goes. This is not expensive lingerie (I paid $18.00) so I don't expect it to last too long, but again, for the money, it's a decent product.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought this one night on an Ambien induced Amazon shopping spree and woke up to the order being shipped already but I was like ‚Äúwow, this is actually really pretty, I‚Äôll see what it‚Äôs like when it gets here!‚ÄùThis is a wonderful inexpensive robe, I wear it around my home over my night clothes (I‚Äôm a t shirt and booty shorts person) without the sash and it‚Äôs lovely. It is super soft and comfortable on, but the best part is it really makes my husband happy, too! Definitely spiced up my bland bed time/loungewear wardrobe with ease lolI purchased it in black but I‚Äôll be buying it in another color as well, don‚Äôt sleep on this robe! I‚Äôm even ordering another one for when my current one eventually gets old and sad. Worth every penny!It can be a beautiful, sexy and elegant neglige for your partner‚Äôs enjoyment, but it can be worn for so much more than just bedroom activities lolThis would be gorgeous for a boudoir shoot! Omg! Girl, GITCHU ONE

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I really love this robe and ordered a larger size because the medium was a little too constricting in the arms/shoulder.  I'm 5'4"", 128 lbs., and size 36B in bras, but my arm movement felt restricted in the medium size, which should have fit based on reviews and size chart.  Really hoping the large works out because it's super cute and flattering, even on older women.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is just beautiful. I wore it for boudoir photos to cover up my arms cuz they are flabby and gross and it was perfect because it hid some but still could see skin through it. It‚Äôs soft and comfortable. I did order a size up because it said to in the reviews and it fits perfect! I‚Äôm sooo happy I will buy more in other colors for sure

  I LOVE IT !! I got an xl because I was afraid it wouldn‚Äôt fit but i could of gotten an L and it would of fit even better.I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 215lb and 40D in bra and this fit great but loose, glad it has adjustable straps.I also wanna say it had more good reviews than bad but all the bad ones said the same thing about the strap snapping off so when I got it I pulled on all the straps before trying it on and they all held up so idk.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Quality item! The fit is amazing...I‚Äôm a curvier woman and I was concerned about the fit for the bottom and when I tried it on I had no issues! Would definitely suggest purchasing it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This body suit is amazing. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and 140lbs and this medium fit pretty well (it‚Äôs a little long in the torso) and I honestly was considering returning for a small. I‚Äôm just going to keep the medium but it‚Äôs super stretchy and comfy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  5‚Äô10‚Äù / 150lbs / ordered a largeSoft, delicate, and cute! Runs a bit big in the chest (I‚Äôm a 36c) so I‚Äôm going to try sizing down to the medium. Couldn‚Äôt be worn with a bra but could use bathing suit pads in the top for more lining or support. The bottom part is all black and comes up pretty high ‚Äî would need really high waisted bottoms so it doesn‚Äôt show. Also the snap closures are large plastic and really easy to close, which will be nice if it‚Äôs ever safe to drink in bars again lol

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ADORE this item. I wasn‚Äôt sure at first. Looking for something similar to Thistle & Spire... fits amazing. Not tight/not loose. I‚Äôm a 36DD and got a large. The fabric is great quality (more desirable over most VS ‚Äúlingeries‚Äù) and it can be worn under a cardigan and with some high waist pants. The cups are not see through. I would buy this again and probably will purchase other colors if avail. HIGHLY recommend.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This was exactly how it looked in the picture. I was worried about the fit because of my boobs but a medium fit it perfectly. Loved this product will be buying the white one soon!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Honey hurry up and get it! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô71/4 üòú. I weight 215 a size L or Xl to be comfortable. First brought this to wear underneath my anniversary dress. As a little tease!  But plans changed so the slammin red dress was no longer appropriate and we were celebrating our anniversary with out best friends. So I‚Äôm always respectful and dressconservative when we‚Äôre around other couples. Baby I never felt so good and when he saw me walk out our restroom. He damn near ripped this remarkable lingerie. I‚Äôm 39. 40 is welcoming if I can feel like this all day! I‚Äôd take it! I‚Äôm buying more! You‚Äôre welcome! My husband said just wear this from now on underneath your clothes. üíãüíãüíã

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Upon receiving it, the seems were all messed up. lines were even, extra fabric wasnt cut off, and the straps located in the front of the piece (criss-cross straps) easily came undone as there was only two stitches holding it together . Where the clips are in the crouch, there was an extra thick, prickly fabric that i had to cut to make even so it wasnt pricking at my skin! I restitched all of the criss-cross straps as some were completely detached and others would easily detached with even the slightly pull.I kept it because i loved the design but upon wearing it the first time months after buying it i realized how wrong i was to keep it. The very first time wearing it the clips in the crotch area came completely undone. The thing basically came all undone!CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP PRODUCT!!!!DONT BUY! Unless you want to remake it!Cut design but that is literally all! Not worth the money and if i can go back to the day i received it, i should of shoved it back in the back and printed a return label.ONE AND DONE LINGERIE PIECE .... actually it would of never made it to the first and only wear if it wasnt for me adding stitches. TERRIBLE PRODUCT!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I absolutely love this, the colour is amazing on & the fit is beautiful üòç very sexy, would buy again.

  kam schnell an und passt auch perfekt. Material Qualit√§t super, f√ºhlt sich gut auf der Haut an. Sehr sch√∂nes Teil, dr√ºckt nicht. Kann man so anziehen oder auch unter einem Tanktop, sieht auch gut aus. Klare Kaufempfehlung.

  Sehr sch√∂ner Body! Gef√§llt mir richtig gut! Passt super zu einer schwarzen Jeanshose und einem schwarzen Blazer.

  Great garter set at such price with the knee high pantyhose, also fit perfectly!I'm impressed with this lingerie set. Pretty cute and sexy, looks like the picture, really surprised this price can buy a garter set including a thigh high. I am petite 5'5'', 130lbs and 34C waist 27'', I bought a S. Used the lace stretch. It was nice stretch and very comfortable. Not even a little bit tight for me. The quality is really good specially for the price. I chose my waist first then look at the under bust. I thought I may need a M. Now seems I did a good choice. Highly recommended! Definetely will buy again. Hope more colors will be comming.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Well we did return it but for personal preferences but I wanted to review the product putting those aside. First it seems pretty well made and a pretty good value as well. It was very sexy in my opinion but the girlfriend wasn‚Äôt really into it. She usually wears mostly sports bras and I was hoping to surprise her with something maybe she would try once. I got her to try it on for me and it looked spectacular, had she not immediately told me she didn‚Äôt like it, we may have had relations right then and there LOL. However she said it felt a little small and that she doesn‚Äôt like lace things because it irritates certain areas of her body. I think it was probably the correct size and that she was just not used to wearing so little material which I believe is by design with these styles of nightwear. It also may have been my fault I was guessing at sizes because I wanted it to be a surprise and she owned nothing I could get an exact size off of in this style. I think if you like being this kind of sexy and can size yourself correctly, then you and your significant other will absolutely love it. I don‚Äôt know how long it will hold up, I suspect it will have something to do with how carefully you or they remove it from them. I found that it appeared pretty well made for the price even if it only would last a couple of date nights. Personally had she‚Äôd liked it, I wouldn‚Äôt care if it only lasted one night. LOL. It‚Äôs very sexy and I think you‚Äôd like it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  If I‚Äôm being honest, I wasn‚Äôt expecting much going into buying this. The lingerie was a 4 piece set for only $15 after all. I could not have been more wrong. This product is absolutely perfect. I have a very petite figure except for the fact that I have very large thighs, so I had to order a small to fit my lil upper body, and thankfully, the stockings still fit thanks to the stretchiness! (To be more specific in case anybody could use this information, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù, wear about a 2-4 in jeans, and am between a 34B and 34C :) ) I‚Äôll tell you what, I was expecting to try this on and the material be AWFUL and for it to not fit me right cuz girls, let‚Äôs be real - we ain‚Äôt all got perfectly round and full ladies like these models do - but no! It still fit me so well! I have never in my life been more confident in my body - and, mind you, I‚Äôve always struggled severely with self-image - and I still haven‚Äôt even shown my boyfriend, all I did was look in the mirror. So yes ladies, if you are looking for a great piece of lingerie at an AMAZING price, THIS IS THE PLACE! 100% will order from this brand again.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm not a thin chick by any means, so I tend to need an XL or larger because I'm broad. I was surprised when this actually fit. I have a lot of hip and chunky thighs, but it fit a lot better than I thought. Usually, when I buy things like this, they don't fit quite right because they squeeze in weird spots, but the material is stretchy and doesn't really squeeze anywhere. It's super comfortable and I'm excited to show my boyfriend for his birthday!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I took off two stars because one of the garter straps arrived broken. The set itself, while cheaply made, is very pretty. I wasn‚Äôt expecting much for the price. The bra fit me perfectly. Im a 32 B. The garter fit my hips not my waist but it looks good. Im disappointed about the garter strap being broken.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It was a little big when ordering regular size. Great quality for the price! However, make sure you read, the wine/red comes with black stockings. Not red. That was my fault, but the customer service was great when I messaged about it! Id buy again!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is only my 2nd negative review in years on Amazon. I expected it to not be the best quality but this is ridiculously cheap and flimsy. Two of four garters arrived non functional, the panty is not sewn on thong piece, and you could put your finger through the ‚Äúlace‚Äù without trying. Garbage product.

  I‚Äôve been really wanting a harness but I have a very short torso because I‚Äôm only 4‚Äô11‚Äù and I was worried they wouldn‚Äôt fit me. They‚Äôre often adjustable width but then I‚Äôm too short. This one fit perfectly! I‚Äôm a 34B and 115 lbs and my waist is 28‚Äù. The waist strap fit on the smallest hole so if you‚Äôre thinner than a 28 you‚Äôll need to make new holes. But the shoulder straps actually had two holes left so it‚Äôd work for someone even shorter than me.I kinda took a chance on this one since it only had 25 reviews when I bought it but I‚Äôm really happy with it, doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôll break. It‚Äôs still pleather but it looks nice. So yes, confirmed, if you are petite this will fit!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  SUPER cute and well made for the price, but you can barely squeeze your girls into it if you're bigger than a B. I'm a D cup and it was tighter than what a hardness should be. Really bummed out because I love the shape and quality, wish they had adjusters or buckles in the cup region.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits perfectly. Will be great over dresses and tops.All of the pieces were evenly measured and cut during production, so it fit very well.Has MANY pre-cut holes to adjust it for a wide range of sizes. Love that the material is able to be cut with simple scissors, no leather tools required. I trimmed some of the excess straps so that the ends don't stick out and flop around. You would never know I did it at home. The ends won't fray if you cut 'em down to your size, and i love that, too!It doesn't look like leather -- if that's what you're looking for, the best bet is to buy genuine leather. But! It doesn't look like cheap plastic either. In fact it's soft amd pliable, and won't stiffen up; very comfortable. All in all it's great material if you want a vegan option, and you'll be very happy with it. Highly recommend.For reference, I'm a 36A and a 30 waist. This could be sized down a bit and sized up a lot more. As far as sizing goes it may not fit a DD, but that may depend on your frame.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  If you have a larger bust, do not waste you time or money with this harness. Inaccurate product description states this harness ""approximately fits 34.6 to"" (the inconsistent) ""size 41.7 / 43.7. One size fits most."" At the most, it will fit anyone with a bust no larger than 36"", with an A-C cup bra size. You are SOL, otherwise.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I like the quality of the product for the price, it makes me look reeeeaaally good. I am small and my chest is as well. It really gives me a nice lift and is very firm fitting and it wasn‚Äôt too loose or anything. I do think that people with bigger goods will have an issue with this being restrictive and not very adjustable. It is good for the price but I would recommend looking at other reviews if you have larger boobs and possibly being prepared to return it. Overall I like it but I do wish it was more inclusive. Also, it is nice because I find it hard to find a good waist to chest ratio for these items and it was a good fit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I got this for a Halloween costume that didn't work out so I improvised and this item was great! I usually have a hard time with things with straps because I'm more petite (5'1"" and 110lbs) but this adjusted for me perfectly fine! it looked great on and was super comfortable.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This won‚Äôt fit if you have big boobs at all. The quality is a little cheap but not super bad. I had to had a belt from another harness to make this adjustable for my chest. I wouldn‚Äôt buy again. I‚Äôm a summary it I had to work with it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It's a little tricky to put on, but it is very adjustable and should fit every size. I'm a bust size 34 E and didn't have any problems fitting it around my chest. I got a lot of compliments the first time I wore it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Looks great fits perfect

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô 6‚Äù155lbs and got a large it fits perfectly!! I can‚Äôt wait to surprise my husbamd tonight in this! Literally so worth it!! The quality is amazing for the price and it feels amazing!!I don‚Äôt want to take it off!!First glance I thought wow that‚Äôs gonna be uncomfortable girls it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs brilliant I love it I will be ordering more as I always do. All of my outfits are from avid love they don‚Äôt go wrong

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The material feels way better than expected for the price the front fits well and the back is not quite tight enough but you can‚Äôt tell by the look. (Put it on briefly, So probably need to adjust) the skirt is long even in heels but I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù Even with that really happy with the quality and it‚Äôs flattering. I‚Äôm very specific and iffy with how things look on me. This product deserves 5 stars. Ordered a large and I‚Äôm 170, give or take. Excited to order more from this brand.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It fit as expected. I purchased a Medium, I am a size 8/10. The material stretches, so there is some play room. If you wear heels with it the wrap won‚Äôt be too long. Overall WE really like this product.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  In loveeeeee with this set (im 5'3 & the skirt is really long) but its still nice and sexy. The quality is also nice and the skirt is somewhat thick. Just put some sexy heels and you're good to go.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I want to start by saying that it looks like the pics. The straps are adjustable so you can customize the fit a little. The only reason I‚Äôm giving it 4 starts is for the skirt. The skirt is soft and it looks cute on the pic. But on me, I didn‚Äôt like the skirt tied like on the pic. I styled it over one shoulder like a sarong. So that is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. But the quality of the piece is excellent for the price.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I didn‚Äôt like that the skirt was so long. The teddy was sexy and fitting. If your under 5‚Äù1 the skirt may be too long.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very small. The 2xl has enough fabric to cover a small but with longer elastics. The skirt is not large enough for anything maybe over a medium

  I am so impressed by the quality of this set ! Perfect neutral color ribbed material but super soft inside. I love it ! I got it in a size XL and I am a size 12 for reference. I think this would also make a great Christmas gift for a mom, wife, sister, or friend.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  First things first: this set is super cute & super comfy! I slept in it last night and I didn‚Äôt get too hot or too cold! It‚Äôs soft & I washed & dried (low heat) & still looks brand new! My only complaint‚Äî which is solely based on me being short and my figure gets lost in loose clothingüôÉ is that the shorts are a little baggy on my hips & the top is giant on me so if I don‚Äôt tie the top in a front knot I look like a sack of potatoes‚Äî & that‚Äôs all on me thinking I gotta look cute in my own damn house where no one is seeing me lmao! (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, 130lbs, fitness instructor for reference) I got the large bc I know the actual elastic waistbands on these cheapy sets squeeze my soul out of my body & I hate that when I‚Äôm sleeping! I 100% could have done a medium, but like I said tight af clothing for bed drives me crazy! I hope that was helpful lolol!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very cute pajamas, but I did wash it in the washer, instead of hand washing it like it directed me to. What can I say? I‚Äôm a rebel. It shrunk so now it‚Äôs slightly snug. The top doesn‚Äôt lay off by shoulder like in the photo. Maybe if I use my foot to stretch the inside, it can? Idk. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 135 lbs and got the small. I could have gotten a medium and all probably would have been well. But whatever. PS. If you have junk in the trunk, go up a size!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this set for the price! Soft material, really pretty color (as pictured), very comfy. I‚Äôm usually between size M and L, and sized up to L thinking it would be a little oversized. The top fits more like a M and the bottom is more loose, almost more like an XL. I‚Äôm smaller on top so this sizing works for me but hope that helps!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  You want to be cute and comfy.... THESE ARE IT!!! Bought them for my daughter and I for a ""galentines"" weekend this year. Now my ""baby"" is 13 and the size of a grown woman, and these cute little pjs were approved by her daddy (for in-house wear only..her booty and those shorts tho lol). Mama on the other hand.... was KILLIN IT!!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||




                    The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†I could live in this all day, EVERY day! Seriously, it is one of the most comfortable two piece lounge sets I own. The material is so soft and has a nice thickness to it. It has real pockets (FTW!) and a working drawstring. I love that the high waist is not only comfortable but also really flattering. Even the sleeves feature an adorable cuffed design. Ugh, it‚Äôs so cute!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The fabric is THICK. Shirt looked like a cropped thermal from the men's dept. Shorts were big and LONG.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This set is quality!! It‚Äôs a nice thick durable set and very comfortable. I also love the rolled sleeves!  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and purchased the small. Will be buying more!

  Buena tela, queda como esperaba, lo √∫nico es que el short es un poco m√°s ajustado

  I‚Äôm only writing this for big girls like me who wondered and really wished someone had wrote a review. If you‚Äôre a bigger girl like me, (230 lbs and about 5ft tall ) then get this girl! Don‚Äôt be afraid to be sexy! My man loved this. Be careful when pulling it up (or down) for the material feels as if it could rip. I just went real slow and pulled evenly across until I had completely pulled it up over my belly then chest. The material is so soft and smooth, truly a great buy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Like so many of the MiC ""lingerie"" pieces that I've bought here on Amazon, this is another one of those will-stretch-like-you-wouldn't-believe body stocking type garments that you're paying less than a twenty note for, but have only one purpose - to get your SO's motor revving. This, in the white I purchased it in, did just that, all while making me feel crazy sexy in it.Any woman out there without a body like the model's in the photos is likely to have some area that she's not so jazzed about, but that her man probably doesn't even notice when she puts something like this on. For me, when I get revved up just wearing something and imagining my man's response to me in it, it's money well spent, and that was definitely the case here.I actually had an easier time getting this tube sock in place over my 18-20 Women's size frame than I have some other MiC lingerie pieces, and as long as I left enough length to cover up my 42 G chest, it stayed where I needed it to until my man no longer wanted it there. The misty effect the sheer fabric has proved enticing, while the holes allowed certain parts to pop through and push my man over the edge. And for less than ten bucks, really, how much can you ask? This one's a keeper, both for him, and for me. More fun times ahead! ;-)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this mini dress ‚ù§Ô∏è

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My wife is 8 months pregnant and it looks great on her, I mean sexy af. Great buy for the money, highly recommended

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'10 40-30-40 and the dress fit perfectly! It has a lot of stretch so your skin doesnt bulge through the openings. Its definitely flattering. The cutouts distract from anything you dont like about your body. Trust me a man will not even notice any flaws lol. I absolutely love it and know my man will too! I ordered yellow but I'll probably end up getting another color as well. Very cute!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bought because another curvy big girl review said do it! Lol. I have lost over 100 pounds, but still going down. And sitting at 250 and 5'6"" with a bit of hanging belly, and thickness all over, I kind of have to weigh what can work vrs how it looks, etc. Now my hubby loves me in anything fishnet especially things that leave the girls out for play. He especially likes naughty things that cover and leave things out, and this little piece is perfect for that. Yes, you pull it off the cardboard and find a  little fishnet style tube. And you sit a moment and think, ""What the heck was I thinking?"" but you fiddle with it and discover it stretches. A LOT! So you wiggle into it and discover, ""Oh my God, it fits, and it still has stretch room here."" yes, there are a bunch of holes but some at the chest level leave fun bits out. So it's a strapless holey fishnet dress that both covers and exposes! And it fits without rolling even on super thick women with curves like me. It was comfortable and hubby Loved the cover/exposure. He could move the top or the bottom, and enjoy anything with ease (and did!).  So yes, one size but it will fit everyone, even big girls can use it for a good time. I might have to get one in red and black (I got white).  So listen, if your big or curvy, buy this! Your man will ‚ù§Ô∏è your curves in this. And yes once Size will fit all!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered this thinking I‚Äôm making the wrong decision in this ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt look good.‚Äù I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and weigh 178 so I‚Äôm heavy for my height and let‚Äôs just say my body fat doesn‚Äôt go to the parts of my body that I‚Äôd llike it to go to.. I ordered different lingerie designs I tried this one on first thinking I look ridiculous but once I tried the other lingeries this one became my favorite it gave me more confidence and didn‚Äôt feel silly for trying something like this on.. I will be ordering in different colors ü§™.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I think it's a little bit expensive for what it is. It says that if fits all sizes, but I weight 107 lbs, I'm generally an XS or S, and it was loose on both ends. Also, I thought the color was going to be yellow, but it's more like a fluo greenish-yellow. I will try to return it because I'm not completely happy with the purchase.

  Siempre compro ropa interior de Calvin Klein porque queda a la medida. Esta me encanta; suave y cuando lo lavas no sufre la tela. Me encantan

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  After reading reviews I decided to spend a little more on this brand. Won't happen again. They don't stay in place. Material isn't wide enough in the front to even cover you so they wind up inside you. HATE THEM!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It was not a multipack as expected from the standard Calvin Klein products. Items came all separate in flimsy plastic cellophane. Wanted to give as a present but not possible. Strange to give someone random three pairs of underwear...

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These were a steal! I was a bit hesistant to get these because of the mixed reviews, but I actually like them they go well with right dresses/ pants. They are so comfortable sometimes I forget I am even wearing them. The only thing I would say is that you shouldn't dry these because the material is very light.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Disappointed, they were marked as invisible, which I thought was a plus.  NOT in my case.  In order to be invisible they have to be thin and have no elastic which causes them to not want to stay put.  I found myself readjusting them often

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These are my favorite underwear.  They are so comfortable, they feel like a second skin!  This is an incredible deal that I couldn't resist, as normally one Calvin Klein Invisibles Thong costs $9-$12!  So you are getting them all for half off.  Very happy with this :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Nice thin material. The problems are the seam up the backside and the lack of gripping material at the ""waistband."" They creep down, roll and creat pantylines at the hips.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  They bunch and curl because of side fat which I didn't think would be that bad...But it is. They do their job which is not to show under clothes. 3 stars for doing their job, minus 2 because I hate the side fat and wish they did a better job at hiding it, not emphasizing.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Generalmente uso talla XL, pero est√°s est√°n muuy grandes a comparaci√≥n de otros modelos que he comprado de CK, quiz√°s hasta el mediano hubiera quedado excelente. Eso s√≠ la calidad y modelos muy bien.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I received this item with the package already opened and one of the thongs was missing. Was supposed to be 3 but only received 2 of them (the light pink one was missing). This is a rip off and highly recommend not buying this.

  loved it, I am on the thicker size I usually weee a xxl and that‚Äôs what i ordered true to size

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love it. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù 135 and the medium is perfect. It is so flattering and soft.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm a size 14/16 with no delusions about what that means when it comes to lingerie shopping. This is so flattering, no weird bulges or pinchy areas. Love it, though my husband couldn‚Äôt wait to get it off me. ;)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù & 170ish with most of my weight in my belly and below. I‚Äôve avoided buying lingerie in the past unless it was a loose teddy. This is sooo comfortable and soft AND flattering. Makes me feel so sexy. I have a small chest (A) so I downsized from my usual large to a medium and it fits perfect. Ladies, run to the checkout with this! You will not be disappointed ‚ù§Ô∏è

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was so impressed with the quality. It stays in place on my body and isn‚Äôt too sheer or delicate. I want one in every color.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Whew baby! I LOVEEEEEE it! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 185lbs I‚Äôm normally torn between a medium and large in clothing but I definitely am glad I got the medium because it‚Äôs stretchy! I have to get a few more colors!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is a great piece and it is very soft. I was nervous to purchase this since I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would fit me just right. I am 5‚Äô5, size 32C and 128 pounds. Usually when I buy lingerie I am concerned if it will be too big in the chest area and if it would be too long and hand (I am also short waisted). This fit great! There are strap adjustments so you can fit it to you. Very flattering and seems of good quality. I am definitely going to purchase this in a different color. I purchased in red. It is more of a deeper red than bright, fyi.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It's very soft and fits well. I have a long torso and usually need to find things specifically for tall people, but this is lovely and stretchy. I did go with the XL and I'm glad I did girth wise (32-33inch waist), but it's actually slightly long top to crotch. Which works out fine for my purposes of wearing as a top or under other clothing. Can't really tell it's loose from a spectators view either.

b.tempt'd by Wacoal Women's Lace Kiss Garter Belt,4.1,183,False,https://www.amazon.com//b-temptd-Wacoal-Womens-Garter-Medium/dp/B00I8HR8JI/ref=sr_1_217?crid=2HKWU10901ND2&keywords=sexy+lingerie&qid=1649384850&sprefix=sexy+lingerie&sr=8-217, b.tempt'd , $9.84$9.84 - $18.80$18.80 ,"

  My natural waist measures 30"" / 76cm, I ordered a Petite/Small b.tempt'd by Wacoal Women's Lace Kiss Garter Belt, and this fits on me well, in the tightest setting (it's a ""bra strap"" style closure). It doesn't dig into my skin or ""Muffin top"" me.  However, the belt is very stretchy. I can stretch it out without any trouble, to 6-8"" away from my skin. What this means is, if stockings are attached, they will very likely be pulling downward on the garter belt, and they will succeed in dragging it down onto my ""usual"" waist area, where it will begin to intersect with my panties, (This is the way it is shown being worn in the photograph). That's ok for my usage, but I do wish it were a little less stretchy. I suppose there's a trade off between comfort and ""having to pull it up from time to time"". If you're looking for a belt that has very little give, this is not it.  If your'e looking for a very comfy belt, this may be the one! I noticed that the apparatus that affixes the stockings to the belt is pretty sturdy, and substantial. The front-and-back apparatus concealing ribbons are thick and the cut edge is ""finished"" so as not to fray. The metal parts are appropriately thick and substantial for the job they're doing, and I'm not at all worried that they'll bend or break. The suspender parts are your standard ""Bra strap"" stretchy strap material. The little ""adjuster"" parts that help you adjust the length of the suspenders are also the same powder-coated metal as the attachment apparatus metal bits. This review is of the black version of the product.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought this to pair with sheer thigh-highs for a boudoir shoot, and it worked perfectly.  I am 5'4"", 120 lbs, and I purchased the small in black. The fit is adjustable, so I was able to get it snug on my waist without creating a muffin top.  The clasps are well built, and hold the stockings firmly in place without tearing them.  The clasp straps are also adjustable, so work with thigh-highs of varying lengths. The belt is actually very stretchy, which makes for sexy poses, but probably wouldn't work out so great if I wanted wear this day-to-day since it slides down to my hips very easily.  I've also worn this for dance routines, and it held up well:  the clasps unbuckle easily for removal of the stockings, and the belt is a standard bra clasp, so also easy to remove.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It's very pretty and the small fit well on the 2nd and last hook, my natural waist is about 29 inches. All of the elastic is in the top band so it runs the risk of muffin topping but isn't bad. Beautiful satin ribbon straps with white meal closures. Isn't super long, and the closures grip thin stockings well. Star loss because the material could be softer.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I like garter belts to hold up my pantyhose because I find them more comfortable than one piece panty hose that I am always trying to adjust. This garterbelt is NOT functional.  I gave it three stars because I can still keep it to play dress up in the bedroom for my boyfriend. It is sexy.  Just don't expect this garterbelt to last longer than an hour. I spent all day hiking it up and adjusting my hose. What a PIA!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this belt. It's simple, and it does exactly what it is supposed to - it keeps my thigh highs up. It's really comfortable and doesn't cut into me. I ordered a small (I am 5'1 & 125lbs.) and it fits pretty well. I have noticed that after wearing it several times, it isn't as tight as I would like (which is why I docked it a star).If you're using it for sexy lingerie only - definitely 5 stars.The clips that hold up the stocking are sturdy, and I like that the clasp is like a bra in that it has three settings.**I've washed this in the washer and let it air dry... it still looks great.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I wanted to like this as it's very cute and fit well, and I have other b. tempt'd products that are great. However the clasps on this were nearly impossible to fasten, and then once they were fastened they kept coming undone throughout a low-key evening of dinner out with friends, not like I was putting unusual stress on them or anything. I have two other garter belts so I am used to how fastening the clasps can be a little tricky, but this one really is a problem compared to my others.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is a good simple garter belt all in all. The closures that hold up the stockings are well made. They are a bit challenging to get closed, but that may be user issues rather than product issues. I'm pretty thin - 5 foot 3 and about 110 lbs and the small fit well. Though the small petite would stretch a lot! It stays up on me but I also have it set to the tightest of the 3 closure settings. It's pretty on, and looks good with black stockings like the picture. The back closure is well made, and overall I'm happy with the product.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Right out of the package I knew I was going to be pleased with this garter. It's very lacy and comfortable and when I wear it I feel very sexy. The hooks are metal so they are much more durable than garters I've gotten with plastic hooks. I love to wear this on Fridays to work to add a little spice to the work days. Definitely recommended!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love this product! Great fit, super soft and sexy! Will buy again and again!

  Love this and came with a string üëåüèæ Gonna order again but in different colors

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  not really true to size but it‚Äôs ok

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This looks SO sexy on. It‚Äôs not as long as the picture showed but it comes down past my butt to wear around the house. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 263lbs and wear a 38DD bra size so I got an XL

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I usually wear a 14/16 pants and XL shirt..I ordered the 18/20 because I wanted to make sure I had plenty of room in the robe..ended up being a bit smaller than expected. I wish they had another size up and that would probably fit the way most people anticipate a robe to fit. The sash is more of a ribbon than an actual robe sash. I ended up trashing it. Overall, nice robe for the price but definitely runs small and might need to grab a better quality sash to go with it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  For anyone who doesn't feel body confident,give this a try! Warning to ladies with bellies,this robe just closes barely.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not the best picture but I actually use this to wear with my bathing suit. It does run kind of small.The lace did snag on my ring.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I had higher hopes for this piece!The lace itself is not bad, had it been based on that alone I would have kept this robe.I am short, 5'2 and this robe was too short on me! The tie is just a piece of ribbon and doesn't look classy when tied.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Would have preferred a better quality belt.. and belt was almost too small for the size I purchased.

  Bought these robes for my mom and 6 bridesmaids to wear as we got hair and makeup done before my wedding. Everyone was so happy with their robes. Very comfortable, fit each person as expected, and kept all hair and makeup untouched as we got into our dresses. We are very happy with these!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is a cute robe. I bought it in a medium to wear at the hospital after delivering (I‚Äôm 7 months pregnant in the pictures.) I don‚Äôt know if I will or not. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù, 145lbs and it‚Äôs pretty short on me, but it still covers everything. The material feels nice, but it also makes it slide around on your body easily.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this robe and feel so fancy when I wear it! The satin is so smooth to touch and the lace features are gorgeous. This robe just likes to slide open eventually as you wear it because it's so smooth and can't stay together. It needs an extra tie on the inside so that it will stay tied, but otherwise, it's great!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This product is kind of the definition of you get what you pay for. My biggest con with it is that the belt for the robe is pretty much useless because it always comes undone. Even when it‚Äôs tied, I feel like too much movement in it is eventually going to expose you. I like to wear this with nothing underneath and if I‚Äôm even walking around my house, too much movement causes the belt to go loose, unravel the tie and expose my chest entirely. The robe itself is relatively thin but definitely not transparent. The color is very vibrant and it has that nice satin sheen similar to the kind that you would see on bonnets. I am 5‚Äô11 and this is actually a really nice length for me. The sleeves are 3/4 (they pass my elbows) and the robe rests about 2-3 inches above my knee when I‚Äôm sitting and 4-5 inches as I walk. I like to wear it when I first get out of the shower because it is lightweight and it is soft on the skin. If you are looking for something cheap and convenient or something to achieve the look of a nice looking robe, specifically for wedding pictures or for your wedding party I would go for this but just know that it‚Äôs not necessarily the best quality of something that you might be able to find on Etsy or an actual wedding party website that sells quality satin robes.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The product photo is deceiving! The top of this robe remains way too open no matter how tightly you tie it. It even has an inside tie to keep the robe on your body, but you can't exactly answer the front door wearing this unless you're wearing a top underneath. Unless you're a super risqu√© type of gal...The material is smooth and silky, which feels nice, but it slides around on your body as a result. Otherwise, I do like the length of the robe, particularly because I'm a shortie. It's very lightweight and perfect for the hot summers here. It stayed in one piece after washing, but I'll be sure to keep it out of the dryer because it's delicate. It air-dries very quickly but remains wrinkled. The waist tie falls off easily because there are only two loops to string it through, and it's very slinky. I love the peacock blue color and the lace trim! This robe isn't a bad value - when it's on sale.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought this for my Mom for Christmas.  She loved it.  She says it is very soft, but most importantly it keeps her warm.Lovely gift.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This was just what I was hoping for: good fit, nice and soft, not too bulky, and just the right length. I will definitely buy another one when the time comes.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is an outstanding value!  Perfect if you don‚Äôt want a full bathrobe.  Snuggly- perfect!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this robe, it is so flattering and comfortable ! True to size  and lovely quality. I am going to buy more . Thank you :)

  The purple is such a nice colour, veryyy close to what it looks like in the picture so I'm sure it probably goes for all of the colours too. Feels smooth and very precisely stitched too. Overall, a very nice one.Ps. can be used as a gift too!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So cheaply made hemline totally jagged and strings hanging out and does not stay tied a large is like a small. Don't waste your money.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I purchased 2 in dark blue & 2 in black . I am happy with all of them however I believe the navy is a heavier quality satin & better quality than the black , the lace is tasteful & well made as well . All in All a good purchase .

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This robe is so perfect! I am in love with it. Its so pretty and I feel sexy in it because of the length and the feeling of the satin on my skin. My hubby likes it too for the same reasons üòâThe fit is exactly as I ordered (large), and looks exactly like the picture. I'm actually looking to see if there's any matching sleepwear for it.

  Edit, two years later!This lingerie is still fantastic! It's lasted well, without any of the lace falling apart or becoming scratchy. It's stood the test of several costumes, as well as getting rave reviews in my love life. I bought another color about a year ago (red), which was a great vibrant color, exactly as pictured, and felt and fit the same as the first one. I may just buy another color this year!2019 review:Oh my god. This is great. I'm 5'1"" and about 275lbs, which I carry around my lower belly, butt, and thighs. I purchased the 4X. This item is amazing. It fit perfectly. Some things to note in particular:- It's not scratchy. It's very comfortable. Sometimes lace and fishnet material gets scratchy, but this is not just comfortable but borders on soft.- The crotch snaps are barely noticeable. You know they're there, because you saw them or used them to put it on, but you can't feel them when the item is actually on.- The straps are adjustable. This really helped me because I was able to adjust the straps so the top of the teddy actually held my boobs in place (I wear a 42DD).I'm just honestly really overwhelmed. I ordered this item to use for Halloween, and I had my doubts. It didn't have very many reviews, but it was a low price, so I went for it. It came within two days (Prime), fit exactly like I wanted it to, and, the cherry on top, it was a low price. I highly recommend this. Plus size girls gotta stick together, so I made sure to write this review right after trying it on.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm very happily surprised at how nice this is for the price! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù currently 140 Lbs & 34D. I‚Äôve gained 10-15 lbs recently and carry that weight in my belly and chest so I wanted something to cover that.  I have a short torso and this fits great lengthwise so I‚Äôm not sure if it would be great for someone that‚Äôs taller, but there are adjustable straps to give a little extra room. There is no support in the bust, but with the way it‚Äôs low cut, it still looks great. Also, fits awesome on the butt. It cuts high up and doesn‚Äôt leave anything to the imagination in the back, but with the front covered, that‚Äôs a plus. I‚Äôm surprised at how soft it is too!Only con is that it smells like chemicals. I hand washed it in the sink and it bled badly. I‚Äôd suggest only handwashing for this reason.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 190lbs and I got this in a XL. I LOVEEE this! I felt very confident and sexy when I tried it on and my boyfriend liked it too!! I wanna wear this everyday

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'9 165lbs. 40,35,43 measurements. I ordered the Xl and the fit is amazing. The quality is suprising for the cost. The lace is soft and silky, not itchy like some other lace lingerie I have purchased. The button closures are quality. The color is exactly as advertised. Excellent quality and find for a cheap price!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Loved this body suit! It fit like a glove great quality!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I absolutely love this outfit. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 145 lbs with 36 DDDs at my age I‚Äôm super proud of them üòù. I got a large and it fit good. Little loose on the rear cause all my goods are up top (unfortunately). I paired this with a black mini shirt and strapped heels for a night out.  I threw over a white button up just in case people said anything.  I‚Äôve never felt sexier.  My husband was happy.  Win win

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'3 and 150lbs. Womens size 6/8. I am hippy. The medium is way too tight down below, but I bought this as lingerie so, it serves its purpose. I could never wear it out in day light with an outfit. The V comes way further down below than the photos portray. But I do realize that I may need a large. But again, its fine for me. I would say order a size up. The material and quality is as expected. Thank u!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Really happy with this item! I am 5'6"" and a 42D cup and a size 20 in pants, I wear a 1 or 2 in stores like Torrid for panties, I carry all my weight in my tummy due to diastasis recti. I wish this had just a liiiiiiittle more chest support, but the cleavage angle is flattering anyway. The lace is a nice thickness and I like the strategic panels that offer peekaboo but not totally sheer. I ordered a 4X and I don't think changing size would make a difference; it fit just right in terms of tightness, not uncomfortable but not too loose either. I may buy it in more colors! It came in a frosted plastic zip-top bag.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great quality and fast delivery ! Fits perfect to my size !!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  survived in the drier but should air dry, dress to success in the bedroom ;)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits perfect!!!

  Very soft material, which I thought contained some spandex, but it does not. I am heavy on the top - this night gown would have been GREAT if It contained cups for support - it is too loose on top, letting my breast hand slightly :( I purchased an XLarge, but probably could have gotten away with a Large. But I do not think the Large would have solved the issue with my breast. I have decided not to re-purchase, but to search for a nightgown with spandex so it hugs alittle more on my body.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  FITS AND FEELS AMAZING. Super soft and very comfortable to sleep in.. but beware if you have nipple piercings and your boobs fall out over night, it does get caught.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5ft 1, 200lb i bout a 2x and it was form fittingso it runs small, i was hoping for a little looser fitlooked really nice, very soft fabric

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is the softest nightgown! I am a ‚Äúhot sleeper‚Äù and this modal fabric is perfect- feels like you‚Äôre wearing almost nothing! Lace is not itchy at all (something I have found in other similar items), and it washes well too! It is a little more form fitting than I had expected but so comfortable it‚Äôs ok! Would highly recommend!!

  This product is very comfortable, good quality, and true to size.I'm 5'6 and between 145 and150 lbs. I ordered a large because I wanted a roomy fit, which is what I got. A medium would actually fit more appropriately, but I like the extra room.That being said, I ordered 6 in black, and hope to order more, which will probably include some mediums.

  Its amazing. Its made well can be worn as gown or sun dress. Shipping was fast. Will definitely  order again. For ref. I am 5'7 180 lbs and I ordered an XL

  This is probably one of my faves from Avid Love & I probably have about 8 pieces from their company. Size large fits US size 10/12 (38D) perfectly, and it provides just enough support to be a fantastic presentation! I'll definitely be buying more in other colors, and hope they start offering more lingerie with nip-nop holes.

  I secretly ordered this for my wife on her account. Needless to say it was a surprise when she got the package, but it was a better surprise for me to see her in it. This was icing on the cake. I don‚Äôt know much about lingerie, but this piece looks really good.

  I am hystericalLaughing!! This is seriously meant for a size 0XS person‚Ä¶ not for anyone curvy and shocked the girl in the picture could fit this. Stretched it to the fullest on my arms for one pic and the other is how it came. Very disappointed

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Sizing said it will fit, did not at all. I don't have a huge chest either. Had extra fabric sticking out on right chest area.  Not cute at all. This looked cute so I'm super disappointed.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is super sexy and seductive. Looks can be deceiving but pre stretch it with a gentle hand and put on slow careful not to rip. It fits. I love this and he will too

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This was supposed to be for plus size üòí. Looks like it's for a baby doll. Could not pull over legs without starting to tear.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  A lot of the reviews comment on the size, which is hard to ignore. When we first opened the package, we thought we were sent a glove by mistake. However, my 5'7' wife was able to fit this just fine, as it stretched to her size.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Husband loves but I would definitely stick to handwash only.  Very delicate material. Would not attempt to put in washer

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is good if you are short and very thin. Normal girls this is not for you due to ridiculous sizing.

  Not for larger thighs the top rolls down:(

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  No matter how thin/skinny I have ever been, I‚Äôve always had thick and muscular thighs.  Like most women, fitting into a one size fits all is completely unrealistic, yet I have always wanted sexy Thigh high tights that don‚Äôt pinch so I can wear them with lingerie. That‚Äôs where these tights come in. I am absolutely head over heels in love with the fact these do not pinch and look amazingly sexy on girls who don‚Äôt fit a size 0.  If you are like me and have had trouble with one size fits all tights, then I highly recommend this sassy tight with that seem up the back for us girls with thicker thighs.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So I buy actual corsets (steel boned). I knew that this one was definitely not but I figured it would at least do what I needed it to do and look just fine. I normally wear 16/18 in pants and dresses. I bought this corset in a size 5X for a photoshoot. It was definitely still way too small. Not just that but the fuzzy part of the corset was not attached very well.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These are perfect and very well made. They say they have a back seam, but I totally overlooked that while ordering because there's no image to show it. Indeed they do, so be aware of that.These don't have any kind of gripping at the thigh, which is what I personally wanted, and they stay in place ok without, but if you're wearing them out, you'll want a garter belt with them. Mine did have the tendency to roll a bit at the top, but it wasn't bothersome.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love these! I am 5'10"" with an average leg/torso length. These come up high enough that they are perfect!And the seam is a fine line but perfect, and easier to line up thank I thought it would be

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These come up really high. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and they were all the way up to like my stomach. They also roll down. I tried to use a garter with them but they were too high.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These roll so bad it isn't even funny. They did get here on time but there is nothing to hold them in place. If you are in a pinch, get these. Otherwise, spend a bit more and get better quality.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Purchased for wife. She tried on and it was too tight at the thighs. Purchased according to the sellers size chart. Also, it look like it was old and worn, mainly at the thigh

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Theses were too small and just rolled down..not plus sized. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend them ...

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Way too small an tight

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My wife loves these and I like her in them!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I purchased these to wear with a garter. The listing called them 'queen' and said they'd fit 18-20. I'm a Banana Republic 12, and these did not even close to accommodate my thighs. They were SO TIGHT that they squeezed the flesh out the top like toothpaste. Not a hot lewk. Also - they came up WAY to high to be able to wear with garters, but they absolutely would not stay up on their own.Quality wise - not good. They're quite cheap and rough feeling, like dollar store nylons. If they were wearable they'd likely only last one wear.Verdict - going back.

  To be honest, I didn't expect much. I thought the only way to get a sexy and comfortable lingerie was to buy the overpriced Victoria's Secret stuff. I took a chance with this, and now I'm a customer for LIFE. I'm not buying Victoria's Secret anymore when I have this brand in my life! I was amazed at how well this fit, how flattering it was on my body (I'm in between 12-14 pant size so I've got some extra love if you know what I mean), And how completely silky and comfortable this is! I didn't want to take it off! It made me feel like such a sexy woman, and I'm a very self conscious girl, so that's saying something! The husband gave a very vocal approval as well, which was the main goal here!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very cute and pretty. Keep in mind that there's zero support for ""the girls"" as there is no elastic, underwire, or padding. I bought a large and I'm a 34DDD... I usually have to buy things that are made for larger cup sizes and then alter to fit my smaller frame. I used my sewing skills to shorten the halter (it's waaaay too long) and cinch in the bodice so it gave support a little better. Super cute now! Don't expect it to fit you like it does the model when straight out of the bag, *but* there's room for altering it if that's in your wheelhouse.The G string it comes with is cheap, useless, far too big, and not flattering at all. If you buy this, buy it for the babydoll only.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is a beautiful piece. Not designed to keep you warm but it is very flattering on and covers the top nicely without being too modest or too revealing. The body is clingy which is nice, prone to static so be warned.**amending my review, I still love this item but BEWARE. Hand wash this alone. This item bleeds dye like crazy.  So much black dye in the water after the first washing.  I rinsed until the water ran clear and we'll see the next time I wash it if there is more bleeding.  Be careful on the first wash that it be the only thing you are hand washing. This item seems way too delicate for a washing machine.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits very well and is not tight on my belly, which I am self conscious about. Love it! Normally wear a size 14. I got XL.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 164 pounds, 36D, 29-30‚Äù pants, size 10, I also wear medium tops and underwear. This is silky and soft lace. I ordered L in dark green. If I had time to exchange it I would order a M or even S. It isn‚Äôt adjustable like many over pieces. It‚Äôs very stretchy though. If I could pull it up 4‚Äù on the halter it would be perfect. It‚Äôs almost enough to tie a small knot but not quite. It works, I just would order smaller if j did order again. It does hold my breasts up, once I put them where they belong but not as well as I would like. The included things fit well with no bulging. If I went smaller the I would have gotten the elastic bulge look.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So freaking comfortable!!! OMG get every color!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I really like this.  Don't be fooled, if you are a C cup or higher-your boobs do not look nearly as perky from the picture.  There really is no support for your breasts.  The G string looks like it was an after thought, and was adjustable-which I found kind of weird.  For the price I can't complain too much.  I hand wash it, and wear it for my husband maybe twice a month.  It's not a VS, but neither is the price!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This was surprisingly good, I wasn't expecting a lot but it did deliver. Of course so support but it's just lace and mesh, even with that tho it is well made and fits lovely!!! Was very pleasantly surprised, the undies however there is not cotton lining just a g string mesh thong but still looks amazing. I can see the elastic fraying overtime tho.

  Perfect lingerie or fashionable bodysuit! Fits as expected and it beautiful quality. Very great seller came fast with prime shipping, thinking about purchasing the other style in white !

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I should have ordered a medium. The large was big around my tummy area but I ordered a large for my breast. The cups do not have good wiring like a bra so it did not hold my breasts in it. It came out underneath and on the side. But it got the job done as I wore it for a lingerie party. I ended up sewing black padding in the cups as it was see through. Very thin material I have long nails and had to be careful not to make a hole

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This Bodysuit Lingerie One Piece is very beautiful and versatile.I bought this for lingerie. I purchased the XL and it fit as described I‚Äôm a 40 D and it fit me.The bodysuit/lingerie fastens at the bottom with three buttons and you can also adjust the straps at the top bra part.There is no wire in bra and you can see through it.There are different colors to choose from. I use mines for bed time only , but you can go out with it by putting a jacket, button down shirt, vest, or a cardigan over it. Because it is a body suit too.My husband and I are enjoying this and have no cons for it yet.I definitely recommend and will buy again.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I cannot stress how much time and money I've spent trying to find a nice lingerie bodysuit, but this one is the real deal! I am larger cheated, 36C, and have a hard time finding tops that support my chest as well as a nice fit on my torso. This product is what I've been searching for for such a long time! The fit was absolutely perfect! Not too snug but it hugged my body so nicely. The material is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! the lace work is beautiful and there is a nice amount of support for the chest area. Such a great buy! Will be purchasing the black here soon as I bought the red the first time around!

  ¬†LOVED IT!! Fits perfectly, supports my (small) chest. I felt so sexy wearing this & my man loved it too! Fit was true to size & was very flattering. Hid my small stomach pouch, and made my waist look great! I am 5‚Äô3, 110 pounds & ordered a size small.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered a large to accommodate my breasts. I‚Äôm a 34D. This fit great across my body, was very soft and comfortable lace. However, it is way to long. 3+ inches in the crotch area, and the cups are too small. There is no underwire like you would think from looking at the pictures, therefore no lift and no support. And to actually cover my breast properly it basically has to just sit over them, which you can see puts the base of the cups no where near the base of my breasts.It‚Äôs very sheer out of tthe package but I felt like the lace pattern still covers the girls well enough that I wouldn‚Äôt need something under it.Overall I‚Äôm not sure if I will be keeping it since I know going down a size won‚Äôt fix the fit problems I‚Äôm having, but for the price it still looks pretty hot for an outfit with jeans and a jacket or cardigan.

  Looks good on. Fits comfortably for the most part. I'm 5'2"", around 118lbs, but thick in the waist, which is where it's a little bit tight. But everywhere else fits perfectly and my husband very much likes it on me.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I read the reviews and was very hopeful that this would work for me. I have a larger chest I am a 38 D. As theres had mentioned there is no underwire for support. In the photos it looks at if it is a little darker in the cups it is not. It is just as sheer as the rest of the body suit. This body suit could not hold in my chest at all. I was either fall out underneath or out the sides. The suit it self is very pretty and has good stretch. I like that it helped to hide my stomach.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This product fits as expected and is made of a soft lace fabric. The chest area is covered enough so you don't need to wear nipple covers or anything underneath. It's very comfortable and the snap crotch is easy to use

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Wundersch√∂ner Body! Er passt perfekt (Gr. S bei 1,60m und Konfektionsgr√∂√üe 36). Sehr angenehmes Tragegef√ºhl und die Verarbeitung ist in dieser Preisklasse besser als erwartet. Werde mir diesen noch in einer anderen Farbe bestellen.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Schnelle Lieferung.Sehr gute Passform.Preis angemessen.Auch nach mehrmaligem Waschen noch in Form.Kann ich weiterempfehlen.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Die Qualit√§t stimmt f√ºr den Preis auf jeden Fall. Sieht super aus und passt gr√∂√üengerecht (M bei 1,73 und 62 Kilo). Es sieht wirklich sexy aus und lohnt sich auf jeden Fall. Bestelle ich mir noch in anderen Farben!

  Like this product! It's fit perfectly, stretchy, comfortable, breathable and I love the colour and detailing. However I was expecting it to come with a bra Cup but it didn't. All in all  I love it!

  I was happily surprised fit perfect has some stretch could have actually went with a large

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I got Medium and love how it fits!  5'5  135lbs  A small would have been perfect and snug.  This is the cutest set <3

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love it fits me perfectly my bf loves it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Again my gf loved the color and it fit her perfectly. She has a very nice behind and it really brought attention to it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs so stunning and the underwear is actually really cute lol

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  A lot of reviews said this ran large, but an XL worked well for my frame. (5‚Äô10‚Äù, 170, 38D). The panties are a tad large, but overall a good fit with sexy, comfy lace. Quality is comparable to what you‚Äôd get at a brick and mortar shop too.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Beautiful color and this lingerie was a perfect fit!!  My boyfriend loved the details and lace.  I will definitely be buying from this company again!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Man I been looking for a gray piece of lingerie for about 3 months now, have already bought several that didn‚Äôt work out. This one is the one, the lace is so soft and beautiful. The back of it is not not completely backless as described in description, it has a bra hook at the top then the rest is a crisscrossed strapping and lace. Its just enough skin shown along with the lace to drive your partner crazy.... I‚Äôm absolutely in love with the thong that comes with these garter sets. They are beautiful lace in front, then in back ,instead of just your usual strings, it‚Äôs a lovely detailed lace design. Soooo cute ! Very comfy the entire outfit is comfy, I have worn this thing for 12 hours straight if not longer. It conforms to your curves, in the omg this is hot way. It does have some stretch to it also. Not restrictive at all. I have 3 or 4 of these now all by avid love. I have bought the Same items from other sellers only to see there‚Äôs a 3 to5 inch difference in the pieces, others seem to run smaller . When I put the thongs up side by side I could even see the difference in size. So I will say avidlove runs true to size. Avidlove is my number one company for lingerie.  Would recommend to anyone looking to buy lingerie. Also the garter straps are adjustable.  They never come unhooked either unless you unhook them.

  I thought from the picture, it came with the garter, they do not. And do not stay up well without a garter. So I'm a bit disappointed with that, but it's my fault for not reading more carefully. I was in a rush to get them ordered. Now I need to find a garter in time for the weekend. -_-

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Nice fit , very plain , darker and a little thicker than I expected. But very nice , not hot , and they don‚Äôt run easily! I wear thigh highs at least once a week, so it‚Äôs important that mine last at least two or three wears. Glad that they don‚Äôt have the silicone on the inside at the top, I find those kind hard to stay clipped in most of my garter clips. So it‚Äôs nice to have these, no struggles just pull on and clip em in. Great price too! Highly recommend!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  They fit my ""thicker than normal"" thighs!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5'9 and I usually wear xl bottoms. I. Not a one size fit all. As you can see the thigh highs attached perfectly with the lingerie. My thighs are moderately thick so I knew I would need queen size. The stretch is really good and the thick was of the tight is just right.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These are barely knee high stockings. The top lacy band is not stretchy enough to accommodate thicker thighs. They are cute, but disappointed because they kept sliding down from my thighs and would not stay in place. These I think are more geared toward people with thinner thighs.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Had snags coming out of the package. Read the description carefully, the garter belt does not come with it and there is no rubber liner in the thighs to hold it up so they ended up looking like loose saggy snagged knee high socks. I used the size chart but these were also too big.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  No rubber grip to keep it in place.  I knew it wouldn't come with a garter but they are very big.  I ordered an XL but should've got just L.  Good quality, excited to try them out and about

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered the one size plus/Queen size. I'm 5'2"" and wear a size 8/10 jeans. My thighs measure 24"" and my calves 14"", the size was perfect. The stockings rest nicely around my thighs it's not tight or snug. For someone with thicker legs the stockings do have more give to them. And the material feels sturdy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Absolute crap. Advertised as ""thigh highs"" but have no means to stay up at all and would have to be used with garters. If I lived in the UK I would return it but I just didn't have time to deal with it on a vacation so I will just throw them out.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very disappointed in these. Ordered queen size as per size chart. They are too tight in the thigh area. And these are NOT stay up stockings at all. They roll. And don't have the rubber lining inside the lace part to be true stay ups like the ones la senza sells. They barely stayed up with a garter belt. Waste of money!!! Don't buy!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  ... maybe I can't read lol , but they don't stay up, need garters.  Quality seems fine.  These are shorter than my other thigh highs too, hits lower thigh area so need longer garters.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Sadly, they didn‚Äôt fit my upper thighs, they rolled down to above my knee. lol. They were beautiful fabric and quality, but the upper thighs weren‚Äôt for us queens. 3 stars for the quality and fabric. But size matters in this case!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very sexy thigh highs! Only downside is that there's no rubber lining at the top so they slide down constantly if you're not wearing something to hold them in place.

  I bought these to goe with a specific lingerie set and the look awesome together. Plenty of stretch, I've used them several times now and they're holding up great. Perfect size for big thighs.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Would give 0 stars if could and 10 stars for embarrsment!  Bought for a formal dance party.  2 hours in the elastic stretched and they fell to my knees on the dance floor.  I was SO embarrassed.  DONT BUY!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I received this item as an Amazon add-on perk and am more than pleased. Quality stockings are difficult to find at a decent price point so I was more than happy to purchase a reputable brand like Leg Avenue for $2. I was pleasantly surprised that the thigh highs I got have a lace top as opposed to the bow top as pictured; however after re-reading, I realized the description does state that they're lace top. I'm 5'9"", 135, and thin and not only do these fit perfectly, but they're comfy and more durable than other lace top thigh highs I've bought. I'm glad I bought two pair and would highly recommend to anyone thinking of purchasing this add on item!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  If you have any fat in your legs dont buy these... The plastic that keeps them up is so tight it pushes any fat on your legs out of the top of the stockings. Not flattering at all  and Im only 135 and my legs are not that big

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Good for teeny tiny legs. If you have any muscle they‚Äôre not great. They just roll down.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits perfectly and comfortable just as in the picture.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love them and they do a good job of staying put while doing the splits, and dancing around everywhere. Love them 0:-)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Choose the one size fits all & it worked perfectly. Paired with a Sexy Santa Baby Doll for a fantastic Xmas Eve at hone

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Small fray barely visible but will probably get bigger, otherwise a very reasonable quality for the price. 6'0 155lbs fits great

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Arrived quickly and was super cute and fit well. However, whenever I walked for even a short minute, the tights would fall down no matter how high I pulled them. Had to continuously readjust them throughout the day!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs very nice

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Stays up 100%Planning on wearing it with my maid lingerie!

  This material is exquisite, THICK and so soft, so stretchy the color is just not as depicted got the pale blue, but it's more pale and dark not the soft teal blue color in the pictures, otherwise freakin fire, 100% recomend

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Literally so cute made my boobs look so good I love it runs a little small so if you have thick thighs size up I got a medium

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super flattering set! Very compressive

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love this bought one in every color !! I ordered a large . I wear a 36dd and the top fits great, the bottoms super stretchy and great thick material.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was so skeptical about this but it was PERFECT! I loved the material. It was thick and stretchy! It accentuated curves I didn‚Äôt know I had. I felt super sexy in it. I ordered a large to be safe because I‚Äôm top heavy but it was still great!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I have a very large chest and the top didn‚Äôt quite look right on me so unfortunately I will be returning.. but I would definitely recommend for others! I wish it would have just had a tiny bit more coverage for my liking. But the material and stitching is amazing and it is very cute! I would definitely recommend to try it, great quality and price!!

  ¬†If this was a name brand set they would be charging you $50 for the top and $50 for the bottom! The cut is very flattering, it gives support on the top, and the bottom doesn‚Äôt create any bunching that other cheap athletic bottoms can.The fabric is thick and stretchy, and the control top keeps my midsection sucked in so that my figure looks cute while I‚Äôm working out (it might sound silly, but that‚Äôs super motivating to me üòÜ)DEFINITELY get this one ladies, you won‚Äôt regret it! üíóI am 5‚Äô5‚Äù, 127 pounds, and I got a small!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The top is fabulous, the shorts... not as cute or as flattering as I had hoped. However, I am only 5 feet tall and longer shorts generally aren‚Äôt too flattering on me to begin with which is why I‚Äôm still giving this 5 stars. The purchase is worth it just for the top, it‚Äôs great for the gym and you can even pair it with jeans to wear if you‚Äôre going out for drinks. SUPER comfy. I purchased a size small. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô tall and 110lbs.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered the matching workout shorts and top and it was terrible quality. First of all the material used was not the material shown in the picture advertised. The sizes were not as mentioned and were a horrible fit. Extremely disappointed in this product and the shop.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Waste of money. Threw it in the bin. Cut and fabric is very cheap nothing like the pictures

  Meh.... Lol. They are really cute but I'm disappointed. The toes.... These guys could not have made it so my toes aren't poking out of the holes of the stocking... It looks ridiculous guys, come on. Not very sexy.They fit okay, a little snug but looked good on me. I'm 5'7 and 135 pounds. They are so not comfortable though! Kind of itchy and I want them off after about five minutes which kind of defeats the whole purpose of wearing them.So, they are okay but not great. I'll keep looking for something better.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm tall and these actually fit me! They do really nicely being washed. I throw them in with my regular loads of clothes. Love them. One pair will usually last me all year, I wear them regularly. So much more comfortable than full tights.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm a plus size woman.. size 12-14..  The band stayed around my waist no problem..and didn't roll down very much.. but the ""garters"" are far longer than they should be. This caused the garters to fall down below my mid thigh.. to almost right above my knee. They also weren't very comfortable to wear.. they don't feel very luxurious.. they almost feel a bit scratchy. I wore them underneath a pencil skirt to a romantic date with the boyfriend. they stayed on fine and I couldn't feel them move.. but when I disrobed that evening.. I had to fix them before the boyfriend saw me. I won't purchase again.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  As a whole, the stockings/garterbelt are lovely, and I'm happy to have them. That being said, these do not have much elasticity to them, so please be cautious and order only if you're within the size requirements. The size is roughly suitable to someone who is about 5,6 (I'm roughly 5,8 to 5,9 myself). At my size the material is definitely a bit tight, and I did feel i was going to tear the fabric.Overall really pretty, but make sure it will fit before you buy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Just a warning that I'm typically a small/ or size 6 for clothes and this kinda ripped going over my hips? Which are not very big. So just be careful with them and slide em on slow. Also the toes peeping through them.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5'2 and 160lbs and this product was too small for my thighs. also one thigh was tighter than the other. so Im returning it. it is stretchy on the other parts except where it matters.The part that goes around the tummy is also really thin so it doesn't sit very well ‚Ä¶

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5'4 130 pounds and these fit me perfect

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Looks very sexy in the picture but the size guide is not even close to correct. My wife was right in the size zone and it was so tight she could not wear them.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Est√°n pensadas para mujeres altas o con piernas muy largas. Mido 1.63 y las puedo utilizar sin problema solo que me quedan un poco m√°s arriba de lo que se le ven a la modelo. Son lindas y se ven muy bien. Solo hay que tener cuidado al retirarlas ya que se enredan con facilidad.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered a plus size and I'm not a true plus size woman (I'm a size 10) the fit was too small.  There is no way this would fit a woman that is a size 12 or more.  Very disappointed!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These were a nightmare! Apparently I do not have the necessary PhD required to untangle these enough to even get one toe in them. Not worth it- I tossed them out.

  Cant go wrong with leg Avenue.always fir and look amazing

  DO. NOT. BUY. this is the only time I have ever been disappointed with amazon workout gear but wow I am so disappointed. First of all, it took 2-3 weeks to get here and was lost in tracking shipment for days. And then I tried it on and it looked like it was made for a child. SO THIN, NOT HIGH WASTED, could have made a better quality set out of floss myself. Do not recommend.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  If your thinking about purchasing this ... DONT EVEN THINK TWICE BUT THIS . BUY THIS RIGHT NOW . Literally the most amazing thing . Maybe your a bigger girl and your wondering ‚ÄúHMMM should I get this ‚Äú YES . YES YOU SHOULD . Do it immediately.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  First of all, in the pieces I received looked poor quality. When being stretched you can see through. There is no thickness to the material. The top and bottoms poor seams, just stitched together no controlling stretch to prevent from rising up.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am gonna assume that this seller either has different manufacturers and sometimes you get a good quality set and sometimes you get a bad one. I did have to wait approx 2-3 weeks until mine arrived and I was hoping I wouldn't be disappointed, and I wasn't. I bought another style from this same seller that has 4.5 stars and added that to a pic to see the comparison (light blue set). This set came with the same quality and fit as the set that was 4.5 stars; it is nice and thick, not see-through, and hugs all the right curves. The bra came with removable pads and in the photos I took them out so I do not know how the bra fits with them in. I would recomment taking a chance on this set, hopefully you get the good quality one. The only issue I seemed to encounter was there is no tag on the shorts so I wasn't 100% sure what was the back and what was the front, also the inside stitching seems a little sketchy, so I wont be putting this in the dryer or washing on a high tumble speed. I would strongly recommend, and I hope you get lucky to get the nice set. [5'1, 145lbs, got brown color in a Medium]

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love these! Fit perfectly. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and weigh 127. They suck in/hide the little bit of loose skin/stretch marks from having my baby. The material is thick but not so thick that it feels sweaty. The top holds the girls in great as well, although I‚Äôm only a C cup so that‚Äôs not saying much hahah I definitely recommend these though.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm obsessed with this outfit. Thick, quality fabric that hugs and fits perfectly! I bought it in 3 colors and love them all.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I loved everything about it! I got a M and I‚Äôm 170-175 range. 5‚Äô7 and it fits perfect! Super stretchy as well

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Set is perfect. I am 5‚Äô2 and weigh 140 I got a medium and it fits perfect. I‚Äôm always in between a small and medium but this medium fit. I love the top and fits perfect I‚Äôm a 36 c so medium worked.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My first review was ""flagged"" because I requested refund!do not purchase this item!it was not at all what was advertised, the only thing the that was right about this item was the colour.this wouldn't have fit my 8 year old. it was see thru, there are holes in the seams and the material is NOT what they show in the picture.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  DO NOT ORDER! This product is absolutely horrible! The wrong colours arrived as well as they were the completely wrong size and see through. The worst quality product! When requesting a refund they suggested I gift it to a friend!! Absolute awful product and even worst service! Never order these sets or anything else from this company!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is not a seamless fabric, and the colour i is definitely not as shown. I ordered brown and it is a burgundy colour, and the fabric is a thin flimsy ribbed jersey material. Definitely not a work out set.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very thin material. Runs small. Top came with a hole in it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs literally the thinnest material every and SO see through. There is no way this is meant to workout in. The top also has no support.

  Finding Lingerie that flatters my shape is difficult for me because I have a short torso, small bust along with hips and a butt so it's usually a miss. After seeing some of the pictures reviewing this product, I wanted to give it a try and I'm glad I did! I LOVE this product. Although my product looks different from the pic, it is the same. I am only 5'2, 125lbs so I had plenty of room to stretch it down lol. At first, I wore it like the picture but to me, it didn't flatter me that much so I played with moving the design down to give my torso a bit more design and I'm glad I did. Lingerie is suppose to enhance what you naturally have. :) I hope this picture helps diverse this product a bit because it truly works for many body shapes and all ethnicities.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super sexy , I love the fit, hugs my body in the right places. My husband loved it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very sexy! Fits my body perfectly and the fabric feels good. As it was mentioned before, be careful when putting on/off as the material is very thin and easy to damage.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not the best quality material, and putting it on I'm scared I'll rip it with my acrylic nails, but definetly sexy and form fittinget. Looks great on and the husband loves it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This product fit like a glove! I am 5'2"", roughly 98lbs, with size 36A bust.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bought this for my wife. Material is super soft, I was expecting a more polyester feel, but this is more like a cotton feel. It's super stretchy, the thing comes in a bag the size of an index card and when she first saw it she laughed and said there's no way that'll fit (she's 5'6ish, 150ish, B cup with hips). It totally fit, and mmmmm. Could wear it on its own, or could wear it over/under other clothes as a tantalizing combo outfit.The one star deduction is because she said it feels like it could fall apart at any moment because the threads are so soft. If it lasts longer than a couple times through the laundry, I'll update to add a fifth star.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This lingerie didn‚Äôt catch my eye at all, but as I was scrolling through Amazon looking for lingerie, it caught my boyfriend‚Äôs eye. I humored him, added it to my cart, and then saved it for later completely forgetting about it. Fast forward a couple weeks and I‚Äôm looking to buy lingerie for Valentine‚Äôs Day. I saw this in my save for later, and though I didn‚Äôt think it was my style at all, I decided to surprise my boyfriend with it because I knew how much he liked it. Well, it ended up being one of my favorite pieces of lingerie! It fits great, accentuates my curves, and, well, my boyfriend LOVED it, so much so, he was rendered speechless. It‚Äôs a little fragile but I was expecting that. Beautiful piece!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Alright so even though this piece didn't fit as I would have expected based on the other reviews, I'm still giving it five stars because the hubs loved it and that's all that mattered to me.  The ONLY issue I had with this piece was in the chest area.  If you have nice, full breast, then you have nothing to worry about.  If you're like me, who sits at a B (but not impressively), then you're not going to look like the girl in the image.  Again, my husband didn't  care about that one bit.  I felt extremely sexy in this and was really impressed at how much stretch it has.  I believe this piece could fit a woman up to a size 14 with no problem.

  Great for my lingerie party! Popped in my pictures!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm a size 6/8 and I wear a 34 D, I bought a large and most of it fit great! The fabric on the band of the bra did fold over quite often and the underwear was oversized. However those weren‚Äôt deal breakers for me!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  When shopping for this lingerie I was really expecting it not to fit. The reviews didn‚Äôt do too much justice. But I will say if you‚Äôre thinking about purchasing please do! I purchased XL, & I am 5‚Äô7 and Weight  190ibs my bust size is 42DD & the bra shockingly fit & held my girls pretty well. So i would say it‚Äôs true to size. My only issue is the bikini area was too big overall & did not fit my large bikini area lol. Also the guarder was pretty flimsy.. but no big deal! It‚Äôs perfect for the bedroom & I recommend

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  If you're on the fence, buy it! I wear a medium in shirts and size 6 in old navy jeans. I'm not skinny but not chubby either. I have a little extra fluff in the middle from having two kids, a decent bum and hips. I have never bought lingerie and this was a great first purchase. I'm a flat 36D because of nursing two kids. The bra was comfy, cute and held the girls in with a little peek on the top. The g string is adorable but about as comfortable as a thong can be. The garter was the best part! So flattering! The back was a little itchy but it's a thin/sheer fabric so I didn't expect silk. The connectors were strange and were hard to put on the stockings but I ended up just letting them dangle. All in all I would buy again!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Was super excited to get this and surprise my husband. I received it in good timing and it was beautiful, however there are a couple downfalls...1. The material is thin and when I pulled it out of the package it already had holes in it in some areas2. It doesn‚Äôt come with stockings so you will need to purchase separately (not too much of a bother, but it would be nice to include what‚Äôs shown in the picture)3. Attaching the stockings to the garters was a PAIN and took so much time. Thank God for a patient husband, but when it came down to business, I went from looking sexy to looking crazy trying to unhook myself and it took too much time trying to get out of this contraptionNow on a positive note, it fit perfectly! The bra made the girls look nice and the whole outfit altogether made me look and feel my best. I am 150 pounds and usually wear a size 10 in jeans or a size M and for bras I wear a 36C. Get the medium, trust me!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I usually wear medium in clothes, so I ordered a medium. Fit just right. I'm 5'0"",140 LBS, 34D, with a 30 inch waist. definitely had some stretch to the garter

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I loved this set so much, feels so comfortable and soft on my skin, does not feel scratchy at all which is a must! I got myself a Medium, since I am a 36 DD. I am a little smaller on the waist, so the middle part fit me a little loose, but wasn‚Äôt much of a problem at all for me because I could wear it however I‚Äôd like. Would definitely recommend adding this to your lingerie collection!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought the green one in medium, it's a beautiful color. I'm 5'0"", 32ddd, 129 lbs, the bottom fit well, the bra cup size was just a little too small for me, but the material is stretchy enough to squish the girls in, but just barely. It would be nice if we could mix and match sizes. Besides that, I love it, the color is very vibrant and is the exact color shown here.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love! I probably should‚Äôve went to my original size but I sized up in case. It still fits and it‚Äôs adjustable but I should‚Äôve took my size because I‚Äôm on the tightest it can go on the garter belt and I could probably go tighter. Underwear were huge but I never keep the underwear with sets I buy so I knew before buying the outfit that I would just be wearing black underwear that I already own.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  but the lace is not as stiff as the kind you get at higher end stores and the medium is quite small - I‚Äôm a 36 C and this is more like a 34B

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  One of my favourite lingerie sets now. I got it in red and I feel gorgeous in it. I‚Äôll definitely be getting another colour in the future!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Wire is bra came out right away. Too bad because it‚Äôs very nice

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is a very nice set based on its price

  I am 5'6"" / 205lbs, these actually fit me quite well without the top lace digging in and giving my thigh a muffin top! I do wish the top had some of the sticky gel to help them stay up, I used a garter belt so not a huge deal but without it they slowly started sliding down and once I unhooked from the belt they just went right down my leg. For the money I am happy and the hubby was very happy with them as well üòä

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I normally wear a size 18 or 2 at Torrid; 5'3 210lbs.  I have pretty heavy thighs.  These fit fine (come up to the upper/mid part of my thigh and fit around my thigh).  Other thigh highs I have purchased in the past are either too long if they fit around my thigh or cut into my thigh if they are the right length.  These are the best fitting that I have tried.  You have to wear a garter belt to keep them up.  They slide right down as soon as you move without a garter.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered queen size.  The chart indicates that queen size is for people 4'-11"" to 5'-10"" and weigh between 160 and 240 lbs.  I am 5'-8"" and weight 165 lbs.  I could just barely get these pulled on to reach the garter straps on my oversize garter belt and those straps are extra long.  The stockings come to just above my knees.  If you are more than 160 lbs and more than 5'-6"" tall I do not recommend you buy these.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Do fall down, has no ""grippy"" texture at the thighs. It has no rubbery lining at the thigh/top. I am 270 lbs at 5' 6"" and they rolled down immediately. But are very low cost, so I got what I paid for.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  They are soft and comfy and I liked the size of the fishnet. But definitely you'll need garters. The tops are Lacey and soft too, but no elastic to hold them up (which I knew after reading other reviews).I tried them with some garters with the metal hearts (you know the ones!) But the tights would fall on the opposite side.I recommend garters with straps on opposite sides. Like a typical garter belt has on the back and front. üòä Enjoy!5'8 170lbs and some thick thighs for reference on my size.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not what I ordered at all. I saw the pictures from other reviews and they got what looks exactly like the picture so I ordered it. Instead, I got regular sized plain black stockings. No lace, no fishnet, and most definitely not plus size. Extremely disappointed. I chose the option to have my order resent with the correct product and I'm hoping I actually get what I ordered this time...

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super sexy! Tried these on a whim with another item and they are very good quality for the price. The fit is great and there is plenty of give in the material to avoid catching and snaring. I'm 5-7 and 168 lbs, the Q1 worked well for me. I would say my thighs are swimmer size and definitely not sticks. I could have sized down, however I appreciate that the extra give will ensure they last more than one use. Definitely to be paired with a garter belt, of which I purchased this one: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0094VP8VC?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1 and together with some heels, wowza. Husband loved it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I found these extra large and for me that is saying a lot. The material is great, soft, and does not tear easily. I have very thick thighs and calves. So regular size stockings are out of the question. My calves are 19.5 inches and my thighs even deliciously bigger. But these just kept falling down. you will need a garter belt with these. I am 190lbs size 12. But the material is lovely!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great as described.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  too long in leg

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought a piece of plus size lingerie which fooled me into thinking thigh high stockings were included, so I found this cheap pair and it served my purposes perfectly(tried ensemble today for long term boyfriendü•∞) considering it took longer to get them on and strapped in compared to how long I was wearing them LOL(never wore a girdle type piece before).

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  No me ha gustado nada,no tiene ni elastico ni silicona en la parte de arriba,con lo cual se resvalan y se caen en cuanto te mueves,no las recomiendo para nada,porque adem√°s de ser caras ,son inutiles

  I always get sucked into buying cheap lingerie on Amazon, and it never works for my 34DD boobs and med waist. This bad boy though... Super sexy, soft, stretchy- but supportive enough to be super flattering. I can shove all my floppy breast tissue into the supportive mesh breast cups and they stay put like i'm 10 years younger. Underwire is perfectly situated to be helpful and not harmful. 10/10 recommend.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  If you are hesitant to buy this because you have large cup and smaller band size, don't be.  I am a 34H/36G and the cups stretched to fit me like a demi.  Lace is so soft too!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The underwire is a huge plus. This soft and silky babydoll is actually flattering on my plus sized lg chested frame. The xlg fit my 38 DDD cup well. Couldn‚Äôt go jogging in it. But that wasn‚Äôt the intent. Panties are chose cheap string things. But over all very cute and fits nicely

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I purchased the wine color in XXL. I am size 18/20 (2X), 40D bust, 51‚Äù hips, 235 lbs. I love how soft and stretchy the lace feels, it is not stiff or scratchy. The cups fit me good and the straps are adjustable. It was just a little small on the bottom half around my hips/midriff, causing the front to lay open wider than I‚Äôd like... I wanted more coverage over my imperfect belly. The thongs that usually come with these sets never fit me right so that was not a big deal. I think there is a little extra room in the top for someone slightly bigger than me but if you are bigger on the bottom half, it won‚Äôt fit right. All in all this is a lovely, sexy set and worth the price!  If you are narrower in in hips than me, get it, you won‚Äôt regret it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  5'6"", 160 lbs, 38D and I ordered a large but could have gotten away with a medium as the cup is the tiiiiiniest bit too big.  This is adorable, good quality ( I have laundered in a lingerie bag on cold/delicate & hung dry several times, all stitching intact), and amazingly has actual real underwire and straps that provide SUPPORT, miracle of miracles.  I wish I could find other pieces with the support that aren't as ""cutesy"".  Great purchase.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I don‚Äôt expect much when I order clothes from Amazon, so this really surprised me at how cute, sexy, and comfortable it is. Makes you feel 100 percent sexy. The lace is not rough/itchy at all. The red/maroon color is gorgeous in person!!! I‚Äôm usually between a M/L with 38C top and I got a Large. Fits me perfectly. I‚Äôm also short, so the length hits me upper mid thigh.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This was a total fail on so many levels.  First off the ""g-string"" that is sent is not even usable.  It will probably fit a 12 year old girl not a grown woman with a developed lower private area.  I am 235 pounds, 5'6"" and wear a 38DDD.  I bought the XXL after reading reviews that if you have a large chest get a bigger size.  I also purchased this because of the underwire.  The underwire is useless.  If you have natural large breasts that hang like most women's do this is not flattering at all.  I was so excited when I got this and wanted it to look good, and it was a disaster from the beginning.  I am sending this back ASAP for a refund!!!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love the very comfortable underwire support and the super stretchy lace that fits a nice range of boob sizes!  I shopped several nicer lingerie retailers and couldn't find anything this well made with this much support for those of us who aren't a C cup or less.  Would totally recommend this as an incredible Amazon find!

  I am 5'6"" and 205lbs. I bought an extra lrg. It is the best designed nightgown I have ever owned. It is comfy, does not let the girls go free or put you in an embarrassing situation when you bend over.It is very thin but oh so soft.When your sleeping it does not gather up in your armpits and try to choke you either.Love, love , love! This nightgown.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought two of these, in different colors. The cotton knit fabric is very soft and breathable. The elastic in the back keeps it in place well, so breasts don't slip out. These are very comfortable nightgowns.One bit of advice: In other reviews, writers express disappointment that their nightgown were not cotton. This is because there are two different nightgowns sold in this listing, and it's not very obvious. If you want cotton, order the first nightgowns shown. In about the middle of the pictures, the style is subtly different, and those are made of rayon. The list states this, but it tends to be lost at the beginning of the large block of text.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I looked through many, many pages of nightgowns on Amazon before choosing this one. I knew I wanted a color my dogs' hair would not stick to horribly or mostly show, as ""whippet glitter"" is unavoidable in my home. The heather gray is really pretty and just as expected. I have ordered from this company before so I knew to get a size small. I am 5'11"" so regardless of my weight I typically have to size up. That is not the case here! That said, it is also not enormous as I have found other smalls to be recently. TTS.The stitching was slightly sloppy in some spots and before trying it on I thought I may send it back and start again. I just put it on a few minutes ago and I am definitely keeping it! It is really pretty. I don't usually like asymmetrical hem lines but the high-low is subtle and pretty. The cut is perfect and would hide anything I didn't want to show. This would be a really great maternity nightgown for ladies before labor. Probably not great for nursing but sexy for before and after pregnancy. I weigh 115 and am usually a size 2. This seems as if it would comfortably fit someone up to a size 6 with no issue.I chose ""no rush shipping"" for the first time with this item and I ended up wishing I hadn't. I really like it! Would definitely recommend.As for washing, I would suggest cool or warm in the washer and line/hang dry to maintain the longevity of the garment. I also often ""hand wash"" my nighties in the shower in luke warm water with dye&scent free soap. Press between two towels and hang up! Works great living in an apartment building with expensive laundry machines.@goose.and.falco are big fans!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  If you are on the fence about buying this - get off the reviews and go buy it. Now. In every color. If you are on a diet and losing weight and not sure what size, get it in all the sizes so you can shrink with it. If you are pregnant and need bigger ones to grow with, get bigger ones and smaller ones.Get. All. Of. Them.This is easily the most amazing nightgown/pajama/clothing item/piece of fabric I've ever put on my body. It's so soft. So slinky. So comfortable. Not too short in the front. Not too low on the top. Boobies can breathe. Legs can move. Straps are in a convenient place that is not binding, but also not loose and annoyingly falling off.Just buy it. And live in it. All the time.I'm throwing out all my other pj's and buying this is in every color.Oh, size perspective... I'm 5'3"", 240lbs and wear a size 18 normally and I got an xl. It fits perfectly.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Lovely fabric (cool feeling!), very, soft -almost feels as if you have nothing on! And though it is definitely flowing/loose fitting, it still manages to be flattering as the neck line is very pretty, as is the high-low front! I think those two features are what keep it from being frumpy looking! If you're looking for a body hugging sexy gown, this is not it, but if you're looking for a comfortable, yet still attractive gown that doesn't scream ""I've given up"" this is it!  As far as fit, I'm 5'3"" 140, very much hourglass (over 10""diff between chest and waist) I'd say it runs a little large. I ordered the medium and will keep it but given the loose fit, I probably could've gone with the small. Laundered well on delicate cycle, air dry.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Perfect for lounging on a warm day...fabric is not as breathable as I thought for a hot day and can be warm to sleep in if you get hot at night. It is smooth, silky,  and very comfortable but just not a cotton cool. I purchased an XX-Large and my 5' 2"" 160 # body loves the roomy flow and shapely drape. The short front style provides a ""non-nightgown"" look for us older gals that still want to look nice while lounging!!! The straps are comfortable (wide style) but not adjustable as you may think by the photo. It hangs low on my short frame but still good coverage. I have ordered an X-Large and will compare in the future.I would have rated a 4 3/4 if it would encourage a more breathable fabric without changing the style or quality!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This gown is very stretchy for sleep comfort and doesn't slip around so my boobs pop out while sleeping.  It covers nicely so I can wear it to breakfast with my grown kids.  Held up well in the wash, no shrinking or shifting.  I'm very happy with it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The material of this nightgown is SO soft.  I am 5/4 and 170 pounds and ordered the large.  It is a little bit on the big side, but not enough to size down.  The rose red color is a lovely shade of magenta.  Overall, I am very happy with my purchase!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs not flattering at all, it makes me look like a giant eggplant but it‚Äôs extremely comfy. Doesn‚Äôt ride up my armpits while sleeping and the material is so soft. Definitely worth buying.The high low hem is longer than expected but prevents you from accidental exposure when bending over

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fabric is very thin. Had it been slightly thicker it wud have been amazing. And the neckline is a little too low.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is a very comfortable and lightweight nightie. Love the colour and lots of room for turning in the night without binding. Love the material and wouldn't hesitate to recommend. √Ä bit on the pricy side but worth it to me.

  I liked ‚úåüèª

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It's a pretty nightie. Shows just enough but not too much. I'm 5""4', 125lbs, measurements 33-25-37 and I got a medium. I could have gotten a small - it was a bit too large in the chest and I had to tighten the straps to nearly over my shoulders. If you're a C cup or bigger you should be fine.The material is soft, it's not see through, but it's very forgiving. It stretches nicely but tightens back up after a wash.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this nighty. I purchased one in every color. So soft and sexy and comfortable, yet modest to wear around the house (in front of our roommate)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  He's happy, I'm happy. Fabric is pretty thin so it doesn't hide much... but that's why I got it! Doubt it will survive many washes, but we'll see. Very cute and good fit/length. Even came with undies, which I didn't realize! This nightgown is perfect for that ""oh I just wanted to be comfortable and cute- you think this is sexy? Oopsie"" play.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Omg.. I am in love with this nightie.. it's so soft and comfortable.. I got a MEDIUM which is PERFECT, I'm In between 143-147lbs(weight fluctuates)... 5'6.5 in height... 34C or 36C bra size(depending if the bra is from China or not)... I want all my favorite colors in this now

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 136, athletic build. I feel like this looks much better in person than in this photo. It‚Äôs very soft and feels good next to the skin. Feels a little broken-in the way you want something you sleep in to feel. The color is rich and saturated. Very beautiful. I will make sure it doesn‚Äôt run in the wash though...I dunno makes me kinda nervous it‚Äôs so saturated. I also wonder if it will hold its shape but I don't expect the world from clothing so affordable. The matching panties are HUGE lol. Well, I guess that‚Äôs relative but they seem bigger than they should be for how big the chemise is(n‚Äôt).I would order another color. I like it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Nice fit. I got size Medium. I'm 5'3 / 133 lbs / 36B. It would have been ideal if just a teeny bit tighter, but going down to a small probably would not have fit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The material is super soft.  I'm 5'4, 107, 32DD and the small fits perfect.  Great for summer time when it's really hot.

  The material was polyester and pretty cheap looking. But it fit really well. Totally cute.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I got a small. It fit perfectly. Would definitely recommend. It‚Äôs short enough to show the bottom of my bum but long enough to tease. It‚Äôs lovely‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è. And i can twirl in it. My daddy says I look like a naughty princess.‚ò∫Ô∏è

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs a very soft cloth for comfortable fit. I‚Äôm chunky and it fit beautifully.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm constantly pulling it up-and-down because it doesn't sit on the waist properly. Love it tho. ‚ù§

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  way to small cheap material just dissatisfied

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Good

  I bought 3 pieces. They were delivered late - probably due to the festive season.These Gs are well-made, sexy & comfortable. There are many colors to choose from. Expensive ? Maybe but I think they're worth the price. I like them & will add a few more to complete my need.I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys Gs.For the ladies who wanna be sexy but haven't tried the Gs & wanna try them, this is also highly recommended. !

  I love it super cute fits just right I'm 5'2 115 got a small usually wear size 3-5 really got here super fast!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very soft and sexy! Just don't tie around neck too tight, it gets snug and rides up in the front a little. I'm 5'1 and 115 lbs, I ordered a small.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Absolutely amazing! First time ordering something like this and I am so pleased. I am 5‚Äô9, approx 150lbs, and ordered a large. Love it. Great fit. Awesome price. Would recommend to everyone.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This teddy exceeded my expectations so much that I just placed an order for another one. A while ago I purchased some lingerie from Amazon and the sizes were Asin and did not fit. So... I ordered this black teddy a size larger (XL... just in case) and it is too big. I will exchange that one. I am 5'5"", 157 pounds and wear a 38C. I'm approximately a size 12 and sometimes a 10 depending on brand. Just tidbits to help the next purchaser with sizing! The order I placed today is for a size L.This material is soft and luxurious! It is not stiff and scratchy. I'm hooked and will be back for more! The best thing is that I felt really sexy and my guy told me several times how sexy I looked... that was the plan! üòâ Can't wait to see his reaction when I'm wearing the red one!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It's cute! Not the best for busty ladies though. I'm 5'8, 150lbs, and a 36ddd and it fit great everywhere but the boobs

||||||||||||||||||||||||




                    The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù 140 lbs and have small boobs and ordered a medium and I would honestly exchange it for a small. The adjustable neckline makes it super versatile size wise so base it much more on your boob/width rather than ur height. Very soft and can kind of see nipple but not super obvious.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This fits perfect! I bought the XL, I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù and am 185 pounds. I wear Lg so you do need a size up from your normal size. The whole size thing always worries me even with reviews as they usually don‚Äôt say what size they bought. The tie around the neck helps to get the length you need in all the right areas. It looks great on! It is soft to the touch and feels nice on. I just purchased this in white also!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I tired it on first and it looked awful. Then the wife tried it on... SO MUCH BETTER! Looks great and easy access. The aftermath shows up well on the black.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love the colour but the top feels on the large size/too long.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Material is good, but I returned it back. It‚Äôs too big

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very sexy . Fits well , although I went a size up. Material is decent quality and does stretch.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very sexy, lace is pretty and nice and soft. It actually helps my shape. I was worried about my tummy area but the way its cut is flattering. The material is amazing, not thin don't think it will rip very easily. My husband had no complaints.

  Meh it looks better with the stocking removed just too much lace for my wifey.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Size: fits all 90lbs-160lbs. Not cute. I felt like an old man wearing suspenders and knee high socks. Doesn't not fit like model. I'm 5'-3"" and the stockings fit just above the knee. Not to mention that the stockings were too wide and fit lose. And I'm not petite, average at that.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Needs alteration. The garter straps are WAY too long, and I am 6'3"". If you are Andre the Giant, it might fit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5'3"" and 140 lbs. This gave me plenty of room, didn't squeeze my thighs or cling too tight. However, it was a bit big. I think the problem is the straps were too long. I'm short and I wear a 32DDD bra, so there was zero support (which I expected), but why lying down, it was tricky to stay in the thing. I would have liked it to be a little more snug in general. Still, it felt sexy and that's all I ask :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Material cheap

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Huge downfall is the inability to separate the stockings from the rest of the outfit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very sexy!Leggings to not have elastic, so totally dependent upon the garter.Love it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bought for my wife and she was real surprised. She said it fit perfect. She's a 7-8

  I love the print (I have two different ones) and it is very comfy to sleep in. Does not support breasts at all. I was hoping it would be tighter around the rib cage to give a little bit of lift. It‚Äôs not. If you have large mom boobs and you wanna go bra-less this is not the nightgown for you... unless you are ok with with your boobs hanging lower than the cup area on the nightie. I wish they made something like this with a shelf bra.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very cute on me got a size larger. Wife like on me. Washes well. Love the pattern. very cute, plan on getting the one with lips on it. I love it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this! It just arrived 10 minutes ago and I already have it on with the tags cut off and everything. I feel gorgeous! I have to wear lounge items a lot bc I have disabilities but still want to feel sexy and cute. I think my honey will like! I LOVE Ekouaer sleepwear and this is my 5th purchase from their collection and my favorite so far. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 100lbs, 32D chest and the small fits just how I like for lounge and sleeping, draping gently & loose enough even if I have an ice cream tummy going on. üòâ The leopard print is fabulous!!!!

  very cute and comfortable material. Fits comfortably.

  fit perfectly i love it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I would have to say this is one of my favorite nightgowns. Very comfortable and feel fine wearing around house at night. I ordered a medium and wear a medium normally

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was surprised how comfortable it was. I wanted something sexy enough to wear around the house for my husband and modest enough to wear in my house with my children, so this was a good mix. The material was really soft and very comfortable. I‚Äôm going to get some more in different colors.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is the best stretchy nightie!  The comfort makes-up for the not so great stitching. I am going to order more.  The back is a deep v-shape.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Material was faded!! Looks old. Item was true to size but that's about it.

  Sorry bout the cellulite...fits nice..I'm 42B 5'3 227lbs and I felt hidden behind this beautiful pattern, brought crotchless panties and high heels to top it off...it fits just right in the legs if you are thick thighed so bear full ladies but does have a little stretch if patient. Looking at the 4 pk now.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'4 and about 200 lbs. I'm hideous and this made me feel like a damn sexy model. It fits great and snug so it kinda covers the bad parts and accentuates the good parts. It is slightly confusing to put on, but I ended up putting my feet in first (through the top part and then just pulling it up as I went. It's very stretchy so it never felt like I was suffocating and you can do a bunch of fun activities without worrying about it ripping. I will definitely buy different styles from the same brand.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought this for my girlfriend, and WOW! She looks awesome in this. She's a petite bbw, 5'3"", big butt, and some tummy, and this fits great on her. She loves it, and I love it. Overall, great purchase, soft and stretchy, and form fitting. My girlfriend and I are enjoying this thoroughly! To any guy that's thinking of purchasing this, do it yesterday!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I absolutely love this. Super stretchy and actually looks great on my body. I am 5'7"" and 230lbs... I am bottom heavy (54"" butt only B cup) I would say this is perfect for my shape. If I had bigger breasts... This might not work. But if you have a big bottom and big thighs... This is perfect.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought this to surprise my husband one night.  He absolutely loved it!  He has purchased more to spice things up hahaha.  It fits very well and is very comfortable to wear.  I feel sexy and pretty when I put it on.  It's very flattering, even for me who is someone of a bigger size.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Ladies! This one piece lacey halter dress with ATTACHED lacey stockings is amazing!When I opened the package, I laughed, thinking it wouldn't fit a baby doll.... but, it's extremely stretchy. Once on, it's extremely figure flattering! There are side panels of contrasting lace which minimize the overall look of your body.Having the stockings attached is awesome! And super practical. There's no messing with a garter and separate stockings. It's one and done. The halter fit is nice and I think helpful for a larger bust.Bottom line - for being what first appears as a shredof lacey nnylon, this DreamGirl halter one-piece is very figure flattering and convenient.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am a size 16. 200 lbs. This fit perfectly and I felt sexy in it. My partner was thrilled when he saw it. The pattern covered my belly and conformed without constricting. I was very pleased.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was really, really surprised at how well this item fit. I'm a size 22/24 and it fit easily, looks super sexy, and my husband literally drooled when he saw it. A big hit!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This product was very disappointing and if I could return it so I never had to see it again, then I would! I read all of the reviews (there were a lot, and now there seems to only be one...) and they were so positive. I was really looking forward to getting this. First off, it was late. And second, the quality is sh*t. It is like putting on a stocking from the dollar store. It ripped immediately and snagged on anything that got in its way. It was very stretchy, as the comments said it would be, but there was absolutely ZERO support. I am 5'7"" and about 170 lbs, and girls who were much bigger than myself said that it was super supportive and held everything in place. Well as someone who doesn't have much to hold in place, it seemed to do the exact opposite. I took a chance and bought this, and will never ever ever do anything like that again, it made me feel terrible about myself and ruined me evening.Thank you for nothing!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  La grandeur est bonne mais c'est fait pour une grande personne, c'est un peu long pour moi!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This product is very sexy and fun, it looks tiny when you get it but it stretches as you put it on. I'm 5'1 165lbs and the one size (which is the queen size) fit well. It doesn't go past your hips as much as in the photo. Happy with the purchase.

  Runs large because very stretchy! Looks good!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  A very cute and sexy skirt with a ton of potential, but it wouldn't even cover 1/2 of my wife's bottom even when she was standing straight.  She wanted super short, and is not shy, but there is just no way anyone could ever wear this except maybe over a bikini, which defeats the ""flirt"" purpose.  5'2""  with full hips, so got a size Large: Front length hits 1.5"" below crotch (okay), but the back would need another 4 inches just to reach down to a point that a full 1.5"" of cheek would show.  Unfortunately, we had to return it.

  This item has quickly become my favorite nightgown. My husband loves it and I feel comfortable all night long. As a busy and curvy woman that is always a difficulty for me. This product boosts my confidence and makes me feel like a woman.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am very happy with this purchase. It is extremely comfortable- I bought another one. The breast area has no support. I am a B-C cup, so I don‚Äôt know how it would be for bigger chested persons. I still feel confident in it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The top on this wouldn‚Äôt fit most people over a B cup, even in a size large. The fabric feels like a thick, spongey version of a 70‚Äôs men‚Äôs polyester disco shirt. Ick.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very soft, comfy and sexy. A little short, but I have hips, so it's to be expected. Very flattering.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I like this nightie. It's nice fabric, silky soft stretch but the bra cups fit strange. I ordered the size that fits me. Maybe I'm oddly shaped? The cups cut halfway into my boobs. They should be twice the height that they are...the measurement around fits but the cup is too tiny. If it were larger, the waist would fit tighter and look better. Not the best nightie out there...

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I did not like this nightgown at all. First of all the color was different. I got the white dress and flowers are a dark pink not like in the photo. It might seems insignificant but it really bothers me. The fit is also strange as the cups are way to short/small and the rest of the dress is weirdly long/big. The fabric was soft though so not all bad. Just bad for me.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Really beautiful, and good quality for the price.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits perfectly, material is breathable and comfy, very light and perfect to wear to bed or around the house! Super cute and flattering as well!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  DO NOT ORDER if you have a long torso. I'm 5'8"" and this was going straight up every crack and crevice. Maybe if you are short you won't have this problem. But to halter it around your neck the way it's supposed to, then snap the closures with a longer torso, expect it to go everywhere you don't want it to. Not sexy and defiantly not comfortable. Usually I'm better at reading reviews before ordering things, but I rushed it because of valentines day. I ordered the correct size (medium) I wasnt going to order a large because I have a small chest. Had this been longer, it would have fit perfect.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I found this to be quite nice! Bought as a gift to myself, fit snug, comfortable and very enticing! Even though I was alone..lol...I will admit, it took a minute or two to figures out the neck choker..I almost mistook it for straps! Lmbo..I can't say I flatter this garment very well, but as a work in progress, the sex drip is on the way! I would recommend this to everyone...I am 5""3, 138 lbs approx..and this was a small.Make it work for you ladies!! ü§ó

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am not sure how to write this review for this product. I ordered an XL. I am 195 pounds, 46"" hip and 38 C chest, thick thighs & hips.. with some extras ;) I LOVE the look and style of this teddy. This was my first one, but this style was extremely short in the torso when it comes up and around your neck. I read in some reviews this happened to them as well, but I didn't think it would be a problem since I am short. I was definitely wrong. The high-waisted hip cut detail on the sides is super high, in my opinion... but I received a lot of compliments on this. Very sexy all together. GREAT cut and detail on the butt area, really flattering I think. This alone, I gave 2 stars off rip. Tried to get in red but, boy that color is popular! Black was the ticket!

  This was the 1st time I bought lingerie in years & honestly, I was prepared to just throw it out if it didn't work for me. To my surprise, it actually fit great! (For reference, I'm 5'1"", 125lbs, 36-30-40 & bought a M.) The waist line is very flattering, it wasn't itchy, & the lace was more durable than I anticipated (with other lace, I've had it rip as I put it on). The red is more of a bright red than dark red or maroon, just fyi. Personally, I could've used a little push up in the top, but was able to make it work with a sticky bra - I just stitched the top about a half inch up to conceal the bra. Overall, especially considering the price, I was very happy with it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super cute, I reordered after getting an XL that was too small. The XXL is great, except it came ripped already...

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I really wanted this to work! I ordered the purple‚Äîcolor was rich and beautiful, the lace was soft. But for me, it just isn‚Äôt long enough for my torso. I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù 180-185 lbs. I tried an XL and an XXL. The larger size was roomier in the waist but not any longer. I must just have a weirdly long torso because I can see from the reviews it fit other ladies with my height & weight. I think it‚Äôs really cute for the price if it works for you!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The lace seems very good quality and is soft and comfortable to wear. I was nervous to buy lingerie online but I'm glad I did! I'm 5'4"" 145lbs and 36B and the small fits me well.

  This fit like a glove! I'm usually a s/m, i wear 34D and ordered a M. My husband lived this! Itlooks exactly as the picture. The material is soft, it's comfortable, and thick (not as see through as most baby dolls you find). I took the bow off and I feel it looks so much better. Definitely recommend!!‚úî

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Loved this babydoll

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Really cute. Like the way it fits. Took the little bow off the front. Like it better without it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This item is very pretty! I ordered a size larger (I normally wear medium) from the reviews and it fit to a  T. Amazing outfit...I just love the fit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It fit really well. The panties that come with it are a bit big but other than that I don't have a single complaint

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Perfect.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I really loved this little red treasure. It fit very well and seems like it would shape to just about any body type. I like it a lot. Makes me feel sexaaayy

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is by far my fav piece in my little lingerie collection. I am 5'1.5 and about 230 pounds for reference. I got an XL. This piece is beyond comfy. Its not constricting or tight in areas as some piece are sometimes. The material isn't irritating. I think for the price you can't go wrong. I do wish the straps tightened a little more, for tad more support but thats nothing to complain about. I probably could have gotten away woth as large, now that I think about it. I do have to say the thong is nothing special. Its kinda loose and I don't like that it moves....but again nothing to complain about because I had another pair of more comfy boyshort panties that I pair with this. All and all I would recommend this set...i def would order in another color.

  The most sexy and flattering lingerie that I've ever owned. However, you should size up. I usually wear xxl, and for this one I ordered 4x, and it fits perfectly. Looks great and not like other cheap materials. Sad that it doesn't come in more colors.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I usually wear an XXL/2X and I ordered a 4X and it fits great. So definitely need to size up, but I love this piece.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not happy, to small even ordering up a size.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this. Made me feel pretty and thinner ! Ordered another color. 230 and ordered a 4x perfect .

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I upsides and still it was tight. Quality looks good.

  Not true to size and does not fit well.

  I was really worried when I first pulled the product out the package but I quickly realized that it had an amazing amount of stretch in the fabric. It‚Äôs a little difficult to get on with trying to stretch it out and unravel the lace at the same time and BE CAREFUL if you have long nails. Once it‚Äôs on it‚Äôs a great fit doesn‚Äôt run super short I just wish the bottom of it was hemmed somehow.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bought this for the wife as she knows how much I love seeing her in lingerie  was not disappointed with the product.  IT is a little fragile, can be snagged easy, but it is hot.  LOVE IT

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Nice purchase.  It's a keeper

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I lost weight and wanted to wear a bikini. I've never been a fan of exposing my body and I felt this sexy piece would work well as a coverup. I enjoyed wearing it and received tons of compliments!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Wife looks Hot in this!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Was concerned about the ""one size"" but it fit great. Super stretchy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Comfy

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'8"" and 240lbs. It fits like the reviews said -- perfectly. Beware when you wash it - the dye runs a little.

  The bottoms didn't fit but we didn't need them.Bought this for my girlfriend and now she's my wife.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Cute but the back/bottom is kinda weirdly shaped. Not a huge deal tho moo

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fit perfectly! Super cute and the best touch for my costume!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Extremely difficult to get all the parts on. A thong is a horrible, poor choice of panty for the manufacturer to sew a heavy tail to. Absolutely no support in the top. Who decided that SQUARE shaped bras are sexy? Breasts are ROUND, not square! Not flattering at all, and not for big tiddies either! (38DD)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Plus size:16-18 here 5‚Äô0 about 210-220lbs undies didn‚Äôt fit. Bought a white thong and sewed a button on the back! Easy! It stretched great and looked great! I think maybe if you‚Äôre petite and closer to 300 it may not be as flattering. It‚Äôs you‚Äôre taller and closer to 300 it should fit other than underwear. Socks did not go up to thighs but plus size, lol didn‚Äôt expect it. I left them just under the knee and looks cute!! I liked it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought the ‚Äúmaid‚Äù and ‚Äúmaid jumpsuit‚Äù. For the first one, the thong won‚Äôt make it past my thighs, so I can‚Äôt wear that. The stockings are also tight and can‚Äôt wear them. The rest is cute. The jumpsuit is just okay. I‚Äôm a 36B, but the strap that goes across the breasts doesn‚Äôt feel that comfy. It gives a ‚Äúmuffin top‚Äù affect to my boobs. If you have areolas larger than an inch, it won‚Äôt cover them. And if I slide the strap to my underbust, I feel like my boobs look a little too squished together in a not so flattering way. The crotch area is also a little tight. In a way that it could feel good, but looks weird lol. It‚Äôs like a reverse wedgie. These items would probably flatter smaller body types better. I normally wear a m/l for tops and l/xl for bottoms.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Listen I understand wanting this, I was hesitant about it and rightfully so so many people complained about the size, the bottoms, the collar and even the bra (if you can call it that) but I got anyways when I got money and let me just say; please do not get this. The bottoms were so small it looked so stupid on if your coochie got just a little chub to it DONT BUY IT even if it does go on it won‚Äôt fit well and if you got a tummy it‚Äôll accentuate it and make it even more noticeable. The collar was small did not fit (mind you I‚Äôm 5,1 and a lil above average body weight) the tights were cute, the hat was cute, the tail was cheap and was falling apart, the bow collar that goes with the other collar broke, got a lot of random scrunchy things which is cute I guess and they approve was cute, the top part was annoying and would move a lot and I was scared of tightening it and breaking it. All in all if you are thinking about getting the bikini one, please keep in mind that it most likely will break the minute you use it or not even fit. They should make bigger sizes or something because for 30 bucks you would think they would come for all sizes ya know or atleast looking at the model.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  this is so cute!!!! brings everything so many cute accessories i love it the top fits perfect its the right amount of coverage i have a C cup and it fits fine the headband is so cute and so are the tights the only thing is the bottom didnt fit me at all its super tiny but i can easily switch it out with something else i love this outfit im really glad i bought it <3

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits a bit off, and tying the back is a little strange, but this was a first for me, so maybe I've no idea how to wear it.

  for me to be plus size i loved how it looked on me and actually fits.

  At first it looks small but it definitely has stretch. I typically wear a large / xl and it works perfectly. Cute packaging if you're giving as a gift. If you want to wear as clothing the top can easily be layered.

  I normally where a small, sometimes a medium (size 4-6 currently), and I love the Hanky Panky low rise thong, but I thought these were super cute, and no one wants a million of the same thing in their closet, so I tried these to mix things up a bit. These are not as soft and flexible as Hanky Panky, and I felt that their coverage was not as good in the only place they really have to cover. They also shift a bit, in my experience, whereas the Hanky Panky do not. Last but not least, the lace, while I think it looks very nice, isn't as stretchy, and I find it cuts into my sides a bit, which I didn't expect since they are one size fits all and I am a size small. But then again, it's hard to compete with Hanky Panky.They fit low on the hips, and the blush color is a very light skin tone color.

  My wife is a fairly petite 5'1"" and about 100-110lbs good figure without being overly curvy or out of proportion. I bought a small based on another reviewer here saying she was similar height and had a similar figure and small was good on her. We found it's perfect! The V-neck comes down below the breasts keeping any bra off the table and the leg slits come up just above her panty line so she's told me this is likely in-home only wear. Would work nicely we think over a bikini at a pool party as a cover up? She looks fantastic in it!The fabric is fairly light and airy a little bit sheer but surprisingly soft without feeling cheap. I'm very happy with this purchase and she said she likes it (first time she'd seen what I was buying her!) and feels sexy in it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Oh man I was so EXCITED when I put this dress on. I am 5'2 so this actually fit really well more as a dress! I bought it knowing that the slit would not be higher than my hips and that the V would be lower than seen on the model so this was perfect! I am pretty sure that if I was taller, it would fit more in a 'sexy' way! I love the versatility of what I could choose to wear underneath. I also LOVE the high slit that is SO on trend nowadays! I love showing off my legs so it made me feel super sexy but still modest. I already wore this out on a little outing trip but now I can't wait to pair it with something more classy and wear it to my formals!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The title says it all. I'm 5'7"", 175, 38C and ordered a Medium. Absolutely love it! I wore a lace bralette for a little more lift/coverage, which also added an interesting ""reveal"", but this has become my favorite dress, hands down.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Do not hesitate to buy this item! Perfect price given that the material is okay. Inexpensive material, so keep this in mind, but it works.It's super sexy. I wish it came in white! Runs true to size.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was so nervous to see what I was gonna get after this purchase. I was pleasantly surprised that as soon as I put this on; it hugged in all the right areas. The slots are perfect, and lastly  the height was perfect for my 5ft self. Which is so rare to find a unicorn of an outfit. Highly recommended.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I know $40 isn't that much money, but this is not even worth that much! Sending it back ASAP.  Cheap, cheap fabric, poor cut, poor fit. And I had low expectations!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  SoftSexyComfyFlatteringHusband approved

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought a small and glad I did! It‚Äôs perfect. I thought it would be slightly transparent but it‚Äôs not. Thicker material, well made and SUPER SEXY!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 168 pounds larger chested. Length is great. Very sexy and good quality material. I ordered a large and it fits well enough to wear as a beach cover up as well. I would have ordered a medium so it fit more like the way the model in advertisement looked.

  This runs very very large. I am 5'3. The garters do not go short enough to fit on stockings the belts just sag down and look terrible. The whole thing was very large and did not fit. Usually these items run small. I ordered a medium. I am 5'3 118 lbs. To big to wear on me. Otherwise pretty.

  Looks just like the picture and the fit is just right so I would go with your normal size because the material is stretchy

They all came in looking very wrinkled; looked kind of different from the pictures and not as flattering; much more casual looking - not what I expected; the material is similar to some nicer tank tops that I own (not cotton); feels very soft, stretchy, and comfortable; no structure in torso and no underwire or bra support; panties go higher up my lower back than expected; no space between the top & bottoms when wearing (maybe need a much longer torso for that look - I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6). The peacock blue/teal one looked the best in person - still quite pretty, so I‚Äôm keeping that one and sending the rest back. The white one looked the worst, like some cheap wrinkled t-shirt and plain panties - not sexy at all. The other ones were just ok, so not worth keeping in multiple colors. Depends on what you‚Äôre looking for I guess. (Included pics of peacock blue/teal & white ones)  2.5 stars.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought this to wear under a 1950s summer dress, to hold up my stockings.  My boobs  are huge, so I'll be wearing an underwire bra under it of same color as chemise.  Front and back of this one is made of super soft rayon knit, which I think will keep me from getting too hot in the dress.  The chemise doesn't function as a bodyshaper (no control panels, no power mesh), but the dress has boning in it for that purpose.  Actual color quite true to the photo, such a vibrant blue!  Wish the garter straps were 1/2"" instead of so narrow, but the garter clips feel like they'll grip my stockings just fine.  Hooray for real metal hardware!  This is one of 3 styles that I've bought for same purpose. Impressive quality at a great price.

  Very cute ! My boyfriend loved it !

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It‚Äôs great. Get it! Makes you feel good that you spent money on actual clothing rather than little pieces of string.

  I really like the top, I like that its see through and is fairly short and form fitting but not tight, and will still *just bearly* cover my nipples as I move around, put my hands above my head, etc. Love the top, but the bottoms, oof, I'll probably have to find a different set of bottoms somewhere. I appreciate the slit in the crotch of the panties, but no matter which way I have them turned, no matter which way I have them pulled, even pulling both the front and back up to my mid drift, their very very loose. In short the crotch is long so their very loose, kinda makes the crotchless feature pointless if there's so much length to your underwear that it doesn't really cover anything. I give it 4 stars because I just love the top.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The undies are perfect, super cute and give the hips a better look. They do have a slit in the middle which is nice. The shirt is see through and a little small. I find it rises up over your boobs easily but i think it‚Äôs supposed to be like that (based on the demo pictures). Overall, cute outfit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  the white part turns red so its kinda useless after two washes

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great. Loved it. Fits well

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was super excited to get this but when i got it and saw it i was like ... oh. it is SO thin the top is see through in the worst way possible with NO kind of structure and the bottoms were so LONG and large

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It runs small, but it is a stretchy material and isn't really ment to be worn for long I presume. Overall a sexy outfit for any one looking to spice things up.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I remember ordering a small but I received a medium. And it was too big in the bottoms.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The material is cheap, not sure it will stand up in the washer. I will have to hand wash and dry.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Sieht sehr sexy aus

  I know I‚Äôm bigger (I‚Äôm losing weight) however, In the process I don't want sacrifice my sex appeal. I want to feel beautiful, sexy, and express myself! I went ahead and ordered this to give it a try and holy hell! It‚Äôs sooooo cute and fits like a dream. It also has plenty of stretch so ordering up a size isn‚Äôt necessary in my opinion! LOVE LOVE LOVE! ‚ù§Ô∏è

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am in LOVE with this outfit!! I am a size 18/20 top and a size 22/24 bottom and I got the XXL and it fits PERFECTLY!!The material is soft, stretchy, and comfortable!! The wrist restraint is a cute addition and I love how they designed the bottoms to incorporate it!This outfit is perfect for adding just the right bit of spice to your everyday life! I will definitely be wearing this more and will recommend it to all my friends!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I LOVE this outfit! It fits exactly as expected, the top offers enough support for a DD/E cup without an underwire, its soft, and the garters aren't the usual flimsy plastic most lingerie comes with.10/10 would definitely recommend.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Honestly LOVE this outfit! I got a 2X to be on the safe side because of my curves. I could have gotten a size smaller if I wanted it more fitted but I'm glad I got the 2x which gave me the room to pull the unddies over my butt and enough room for my boobs (I'm a 40DDD/F in bras) I highly recommend this! Made with great quality material and soft. I will be ordering more for SURE!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  LOVE LOVE LOVE. I'm 10 months postpartum from giving birth to my beautiful rainbow baby boy and I've been struggling to lose the pregnancy weight.  I used to be atleast 50lbs lighter then I am now. It's been a massive change for me to adjust and conquer. BUT this set right here, has made me feel THE sexiest I've felt in a very long time. I'd wear it 24/7 if I could. Reading these reviews helped me find the right fit. I'm 5'4 and roughly 220lbs I got the XL and it's absolutely perfect. I hoped I convinced you, you wont regret it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  ¬†I ordered a size up, but that was a mistake. I am a professional model and I used it for a shoot and wore it for the better part of the day in perfect comfort. I was satisfied with the quality as well.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Ahhhh I love this outfit so much! Usually I find lingerie I buy online to be scratchy and doesn‚Äôt hug my curves correctly.... not this time!This outfit blows other outfits I‚Äôve purchased on Amazon out of the water. It is SO comfortable and flattering! It fits my chest very well (large c cup) but I could see it working well for someone with more or less up top.I also have a lot of butt and it hugs it so well! I really love this piece. Plus the little extra sheer ‚Äúhand cuffs‚Äù that came with it are adorable

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is not the cheapy lingerie you normally find online. This is durable mesh/lace material with great stretch and hold. I am normally a 40D cup with a sz 16pant size and some extra belly, I purchased a 2X. This fit and accommodated my shape perfectly, although I could have size down to 1x (my normal size) and still been fine. As other people have mentioned, this set is very stretchy, I would say a 2X could accommodate anyone from a sz 14-18 and still look stunning!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love this lingerie! I'm a very curvy girl and this fits perfectly! I love that it's made from lovely material that stretches but still looks sexy. Both the top and the bottom fit perfect which never usually happens for me.Definitely ordering more. True to size, order with confidence.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very good product. Good quality and it fit well. The colour I ordered was beautiful too. I ordered size 2XL, I‚Äôm a taller lady who is curvy, I usually wear 16/18 but it fit perfectly and wasn‚Äôt too snug. Could have got away with XL perhaps. Would order from this company again as the quality of the lingerie is great.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Absolutely love this set!  It fits perfectly & is really comfy, made me feel sexy & look incredible! The quality of the set is great & material is so soft. Already looking for my next set to order.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is beautifully made and extremely comfortable, it‚Äôs not the most supportive in the bust but surprisingly there is some support there, I can‚Äôt get over how comfortable it is not cheap itchy material, it‚Äôs got good stretch too absolutely thrilled with this purchase especially for the price! Money well spent

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fit very well, the colour is fabulous too.Value for money

  Soooo overall, this fits very well and is super flattering. I'm a bit on the thicker size, so it was pleasant how flattering it is. However, if you're heavy chested like myself, do not expect a lot of support from the bra. I knew this ahead of time so it didn't affect my review bc it's still very cute! Looks just like the pictures. Only downside is that I ordered an XL. Top and panties came in correct size BUT the garter belt they sent was a small? I can't even clip it around my waist. Very disappointing bc it's so cute and I specifically chose this set bc of the color and the hearts on the garter belt. However I won't be able to wear the belt. If the belt was the correct size this would be a 5 star review.EDIT!!**** NOW GIVING 5 STARS üåüI contacted the seller about the garter belt I received in the wrong size, and they happily replaced it for me with no hassles, and the replacement got here FAST. SO HAPPY

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Top and and garter were perfect but the underwear fell apart basically right out of the package

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I wear Levi jeans in 12, but according to their size chart, I required a larger size so I trusted their measurements. On the tightest hook, garter belt moves about. The bra hooks and straps aren‚Äôt going to lift DD cups.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Would def buy again

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Good to buy. Lace looks pretty nice. Overall look is good.

  Loved this.! It fit as expected and hugged me in all the right places and was very flattering. I would definitely purchase again

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Wow, what a wonderful surprise! It is true to size and the fabric feels so soft! It has a lot of stretch and hugs my curves in all the right places. This curvy gal is very happy with her first online lingerie purchase! I bought this in both large and XL sizes and the large fit perfectly. The XL is just too loose and the torso too long for me. For reference, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7, 185 lbs., 36D bra (35‚Äù underbust, 40‚Äù full bust), 32‚Äù waist, and 42‚Äù hips. Buy it; you won‚Äôt be disappointed!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is an awesome item! Looks terrific on the wife. Mid section is very soft and stretchy. Keeps everything looking great. For reference she weighs about 175lbs and is 5'1. Ordered a Large and it fits her like a glove. Very cheeky i may add ;)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Seriously love this teddy. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù, 175lbs, 38F. The XL fit beautifully.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered a bunch of lingerie preparing for my wedding / honeymoon, and at such cheap prices, built for Asian bodies mostly, I shouldn‚Äôt have been surprised how little of it fit. This was my favorite purchase though! I‚Äôm curvy and large busted and even though it offered no support, of course, I feel incredibly sexy in it. The fabric is smooth, comfortable, and sensual. Highly recommend.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  AvidLove products have always been top quality for me! I'm a chubby girl at 5'5"" and 175lbs but ordering an AvidLove product, I have never been disappointed! Item has some stretch! I was worried about feeling like a child in a romper and the crotch synching up the middle but it fit wonderfully and I would definitely buy it again! I bought an X-Large.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'll be very honest: it fits, but isn't the most flattering. I ordered the XL- I wear a 38DDD, am short waisted, and wear between a 14 and 16. I have ordered another in the size larger, we shall see how that goes .Otherwise, the lace seems breathable, the bodice is smooth (12th anny is 'silk'), but the straps are very thin. The girls were kind of spilling out. Like my headline says, I don't think it's meant to be on long! Pretty sure he will love either!Addendum: go with the snugger size. The XXL in comparison seemed HUGE.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I wasn‚Äôt sure when I first ordered but wow it worked perfectly for a costume idea of Kitanna (Mortal Kombat character) Fit me perfectly. And arrived fast and in great condition. So comfortable and I could move well in it. I‚Äôve since started using it as lounge wear. Good quality material.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  An sich ein sch√∂ner Body...Irgendwie war mir nicht klar dass es sich um einen Einteiler handelt.....sieht aber sehr gut aus.Ich hab es etwas zu gross bestellt....trage sonst Gr L .....wegen d gr√∂sseren Brustumfangs hab ich XXL bestellt....L bis XL w√§ren bei dem Teil ausreichend gewesen.Ich behalte es trotzdem da der Aufwand der R√ºcksendung zu gross w√§re.Das blau gef√§llt mir....ebenso die Spitze....

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Passt wirklich super, ist bequem und sieht super sexy aus, was will man mehr? Ein super Dessou zum Schlafen und zum verf√ºhren. Trage Gr√∂√üe 38-40 und habe L bestellt und es passt perfekt. Ein Stern Abzug weil das Etikett hinten tierisch kratzt, musste es komplett raus schneiden. Sonst alles super.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Es passt, aber es ist trotzdem schwer es anzuziehen, wenn man kurviger ist ( nicht dick )Das Material ist angenehm, sieht genauso aus wie auf dem Bild und es riecht nicht.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Passt wunderbar, tolle Farbe in dunkelblau. Wirkt auch bei mir als Mann sehr verf√ºhrerisch mit der transparenten Spitze im unteren Bereich.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Material und Schnitt Top, Gr√∂√üe entsprich meiner  Meinung nach ner ca. 46/48 .Ich w√ºrde dem Body normalerweise glatte 5 Sterne geben , wenn da nur nicht wieder dieProbleme mit der Verarbeitung der N√§hte und die Gr√∂√üe w√§ren, leider typisch f√ºr Produkteaus China.

  Great garter set at such price with the knee high pantyhose, also fit perfectly!I'm impressed with this lingerie set. Pretty cute and sexy, looks like the picture, really surprised this price can buy a garter set including a thigh high. I am petite 5'5'', 130lbs and 34C waist 27'', I bought a S. Used the lace stretch. It was nice stretch and very comfortable. Not even a little bit tight for me. The quality is really good specially for the price. I chose my waist first then look at the under bust. I thought I may need a M. Now seems I did a good choice. Highly recommended! Definetely will buy again. Hope more colors will be comming.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Well we did return it but for personal preferences but I wanted to review the product putting those aside. First it seems pretty well made and a pretty good value as well. It was very sexy in my opinion but the girlfriend wasn‚Äôt really into it. She usually wears mostly sports bras and I was hoping to surprise her with something maybe she would try once. I got her to try it on for me and it looked spectacular, had she not immediately told me she didn‚Äôt like it, we may have had relations right then and there LOL. However she said it felt a little small and that she doesn‚Äôt like lace things because it irritates certain areas of her body. I think it was probably the correct size and that she was just not used to wearing so little material which I believe is by design with these styles of nightwear. It also may have been my fault I was guessing at sizes because I wanted it to be a surprise and she owned nothing I could get an exact size off of in this style. I think if you like being this kind of sexy and can size yourself correctly, then you and your significant other will absolutely love it. I don‚Äôt know how long it will hold up, I suspect it will have something to do with how carefully you or they remove it from them. I found that it appeared pretty well made for the price even if it only would last a couple of date nights. Personally had she‚Äôd liked it, I wouldn‚Äôt care if it only lasted one night. LOL. It‚Äôs very sexy and I think you‚Äôd like it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  If I‚Äôm being honest, I wasn‚Äôt expecting much going into buying this. The lingerie was a 4 piece set for only $15 after all. I could not have been more wrong. This product is absolutely perfect. I have a very petite figure except for the fact that I have very large thighs, so I had to order a small to fit my lil upper body, and thankfully, the stockings still fit thanks to the stretchiness! (To be more specific in case anybody could use this information, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù, wear about a 2-4 in jeans, and am between a 34B and 34C :) ) I‚Äôll tell you what, I was expecting to try this on and the material be AWFUL and for it to not fit me right cuz girls, let‚Äôs be real - we ain‚Äôt all got perfectly round and full ladies like these models do - but no! It still fit me so well! I have never in my life been more confident in my body - and, mind you, I‚Äôve always struggled severely with self-image - and I still haven‚Äôt even shown my boyfriend, all I did was look in the mirror. So yes ladies, if you are looking for a great piece of lingerie at an AMAZING price, THIS IS THE PLACE! 100% will order from this brand again.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm not a thin chick by any means, so I tend to need an XL or larger because I'm broad. I was surprised when this actually fit. I have a lot of hip and chunky thighs, but it fit a lot better than I thought. Usually, when I buy things like this, they don't fit quite right because they squeeze in weird spots, but the material is stretchy and doesn't really squeeze anywhere. It's super comfortable and I'm excited to show my boyfriend for his birthday!

  I took off two stars because one of the garter straps arrived broken. The set itself, while cheaply made, is very pretty. I wasn‚Äôt expecting much for the price. The bra fit me perfectly. Im a 32 B. The garter fit my hips not my waist but it looks good. Im disappointed about the garter strap being broken.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It was a little big when ordering regular size. Great quality for the price! However, make sure you read, the wine/red comes with black stockings. Not red. That was my fault, but the customer service was great when I messaged about it! Id buy again!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is only my 2nd negative review in years on Amazon. I expected it to not be the best quality but this is ridiculously cheap and flimsy. Two of four garters arrived non functional, the panty is not sewn on thong piece, and you could put your finger through the ‚Äúlace‚Äù without trying. Garbage product.

  just go ahead and but it. I was worried it wouldn't fit so I went a size up. i'm glad I did. I had room to move but it also hugged my best areas so good. I am 5'3'' & 1/2(because the 1/2 matters lol ) ... 260 pounds  I brought this in a XXXL. My husband loved it. I feel so good when I put this on. I bought a gater belt (not in picture) and some thigh highs to go with it to. I also loved the extra layer that covers my mommy pouch. I am going to order in more colors. you  could also wear this with a bra under out to a party.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is my absolute favorite!! I am VERY full figured and the 4x fit me like a glove. Sexy and classy at the same time.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am obsessed! Super stretchy super cute super flattering. There is no breast support but that being said I think it wears well even still. Does ride up your butt quite a bit tho lol.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Used for a boudoir photoshoot. It was exactly what I wanted and exceeded all my expectations

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I never posted a review before but I felt like I needed to do it this time. I‚Äôm not a confident person when I‚Äôm talking about my body but I felt AMAZING on this body suit! Do a favor for yourself buy it, show your curves and feel amazing like I did!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great little piece! Ordered for a photo shoot. Sizing was good, covered nicely. Great little camo for anyone with a mom-belly.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It's adorable, super soft, easy to throw on quick, only complaint I have is how high cut the bikini line is in front, if your bigger and have a belly your belly shows on the sides if you don't keep it pulled down

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  To be honest, I was a skeptic when ordering this. I weigh 180lbs, normally a size large. Based on reviews I ordered an XL. It fit perfect and hugged all the right areas and gives a much needed confidence boost. I‚Äôm not normally a lingerie person, but this was a great purchase and I love it! The lace is comfortable and light.  Worth the money!

  Great purchase! Cute, fits well, has nice embellishments (picture 2). Much cheaper than in department stores! This bra (picture 4) is the same one I tried on in stores (picture 5) to determine my size. Check label number (picture 3) in department stores if you want to check the texture or size. You won't be disappointed with this bra.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I have beeen searching for a thong that has control for what seems like forever...I am 5 months post partum and still need to lose some belly so these really help! They are beautiful and constructed so well. There is an inner panel for support (see pictures) and it is perfect for supporting my post c section - wish I had found them sooner! I find they fit true to size - for reference my pp size is about a 8/10 and I purchased the medium. I will be buying more of these for sure!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This bra fits me really well and I love how it looks, but there is one problem. The lace is kinda rough and it irritates my skin around the band. It's not too bad, I've still been wearing it, but I can't wear it two days in a row.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  At first i was worried how this would look on me and I ended up needing to get creative on positions but the end result was absolutely amazing. I am 5'3"", 170lbs and a 42H cup for reference. The fabric is stretchy, breathable and very well made. I absolutely love all of my pieces made by avidlove and adome. This is definitely a must buy :)

  ¬†Fit perfectly everyone love it üòç I used it for a lingerie party I order size small I weight 158

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô 6‚Äù155lbs and got a large it fits perfectly!! I can‚Äôt wait to surprise my husbamd tonight in this! Literally so worth it!! The quality is amazing for the price and it feels amazing!!I don‚Äôt want to take it off!!First glance I thought wow that‚Äôs gonna be uncomfortable girls it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs brilliant I love it I will be ordering more as I always do. All of my outfits are from avid love they don‚Äôt go wrong

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The material feels way better than expected for the price the front fits well and the back is not quite tight enough but you can‚Äôt tell by the look. (Put it on briefly, So probably need to adjust) the skirt is long even in heels but I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù Even with that really happy with the quality and it‚Äôs flattering. I‚Äôm very specific and iffy with how things look on me. This product deserves 5 stars. Ordered a large and I‚Äôm 170, give or take. Excited to order more from this brand.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It fit as expected. I purchased a Medium, I am a size 8/10. The material stretches, so there is some play room. If you wear heels with it the wrap won‚Äôt be too long. Overall WE really like this product.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  In loveeeeee with this set (im 5'3 & the skirt is really long) but its still nice and sexy. The quality is also nice and the skirt is somewhat thick. Just put some sexy heels and you're good to go.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I want to start by saying that it looks like the pics. The straps are adjustable so you can customize the fit a little. The only reason I‚Äôm giving it 4 starts is for the skirt. The skirt is soft and it looks cute on the pic. But on me, I didn‚Äôt like the skirt tied like on the pic. I styled it over one shoulder like a sarong. So that is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. But the quality of the piece is excellent for the price.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I didn‚Äôt like that the skirt was so long. The teddy was sexy and fitting. If your under 5‚Äù1 the skirt may be too long.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very small. The 2xl has enough fabric to cover a small but with longer elastics. The skirt is not large enough for anything maybe over a medium

  Better than expected.

  Love this outfit I felt beautiful and sexy in it.Helped me to enjoy having these pictures made so much more.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very sexy, but slides up a bit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Umm this looks fantastic on! I‚Äôm a bigger girl bout a 14 and I was like no way this is gonna fit me and not look like a Christmas ham in the back.. but surprisingly it‚Äôs super flattering and my fat doesn‚Äôt seep thru the fishnet as expected! Lol

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Amazing dress!! I'm 42. I've had 4 children and though I'm reasonably fit, I still have a mom body. This dress kept my secrets and made me look fabulous! My fellow was pleased when he saw the front, but his face said it all when I walked past and he saw the rear. Oh yeah. Ladies, this is the one. Don't be afraid to try it!Excellent quality for the price too. Will definitely be wearing this again.Edit: Love the black one so much I'm getting it in red too.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is probably the most flattering lingerie I've acquired so far. I'm a 34A so I often find most lingurie makes me look flat chest - not this dress! I look curvy and slim all at the same time. Very very flattering design for your butt. Highly recommend (5'8"" 140lbs)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I read reviews before buying and they were absolutely correct üî• this fits beautifully, supports women who have not so perky breasts and is absolutely flattering regardless what your body type or size üî• you will feel sexy and if you are wearing it for someone else they will be very pleased üî•üî• it accentuates in all the right places and your squishy spots won‚Äôt smash out of the mesh because it is perfectly stretchy. I only wish it were a bit lower cut in the chest but really with the back action there is no need to accentuate the front üòÇ

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My wife REALLY loved wearing this & I loved watching her in it! She had a choice of wearing 3 different outfits for the night and she choose this one. She looked GREAT!! She has a curvy build (size 18) 5‚Äô7‚Äù, small waist, wide hips, big thighs & big butt. This thing fit her like a glove without being too tight. Very sexy!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very fitting . I love it so much !!! So did my Hubby. I'm 5""7 142lbs. I haven't bought lingerie before but decided to superise my husband with a valentine gift . He love the color yellow üíõ.  My breast have been through hell from breast feeding but this outfit manage to perk them up. Definetly buy!

  Looks as pictured, fit a little large since I have a smaller chest. Ordered a medium I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 140lbs 32C. Nice piece especially for the price.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  A lot of times affordable lingerie will come looking NOT like the picture; I've had a couple experiences where this was the case when I worked at a lingerie coffee stand. This piece was very cute, pretty simple, and was sewn together well. I found the bottoms to fit perfectly, but the top definitely would look better on a C cup (which I am just not endowed with). Overall a great buy for the price though!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am a 34 DD. With that being said I was caught in a pickle. I usually get a L in bralette like lingerie to fit my breasts. But with this I decided to go up a size XL with the suggestions and what their sizing chart says. That was a mistake.The sizing chart says that the XL fits a 33 under bust so it should have been a bit tight. But if I was not careful  my boobs would have falled out the bottom the band was that loose.Even if I would have had a band that fit I would still have had problems. The cups were not made for anyone who's boobs are more than a mosquito bite. If your boobs have any weight to them they will fall out of the space between the cup a that cleavage accentuating strap (just a thong for your boobs). Unless you buy the size to big then you only have to worry about a really bad nip slip and falling out the bottom of the bra.The bottoms were great.If you are a busty girl don't buy this. Not worth you money for a nice pair of bottoms.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  When it first arrived I thought it would be way too small. I held it up and was disappointed. Then I tried it on and it fit. It just looked so small. It has long adjustable garter belt straps. I‚Äôm so tall so this is a perfect bonus. The bra is not meant for support, just for show. It is well worth the price. I recommend you try it on before you think its too small. Enjoy!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  the product came on time and after i try it on it fit very well very nice for the money

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I wish there was an extra small, it‚Äôd be perfect. Also the stocking clips are a bit frustrating. Good for the price tho

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love this! I bought it for use in a photoshoot (I'm the photographer, not the model) because of its simple but elegant design. The pattern remains bright and clear while essentially leaving little beneath to the imagination. I was nervous trying lace at first but this piece has proven surprisingly durable. Keep in mind that the fit is definitely more flattering on a medium to large bust size as a flatter chest may leave a little loose material around the edges. I will definitely buy in other colors.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super cute. I have a long torso so I was a little nervous, but it fits well. I sized up to a large for that reason. 34c size 8/10 pants. It fits almost perfectly. Came on time, decent quality.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I really like this set and it's a lovely colour, makes me feel confident. The packaging is nice and secure, the stockings I'm wearing in the attached picture are from a different store. Happy with my purchase! xx

  Fit well.  Great for the price. I was worried about these being too tight and creating a fat roll (that would clearly be a direct result of the leggings and completely unrelated to my hobby of eating a box of Fudge Rounds on days that end in a ""y"").  I'm 5'2"" and 140 pounds and I felt like the one-size-fits-all fits fine.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These stockings worked well for my costume, even though I am petite! However, they are somewhat uncomfortable at the top. Unless you have really skinny legs, do not expect them to fit comfortably on your thighs, although the fish-net material is very comfortable and doesn't rip easily. The top lacey part does not stretch enough to go around my thigh and was comfortable only just above my knee, so it does not look like the picture. I am short (5 ft) with athletic legs so I thought this would work in my favor, but it did not. I do like them, but am still on a quest to find the right stockings that can comfortably go to my thigh area and still look nice on a short person.I measured 2 inches above my knee where it fits comfortably -15 inches - and the thickest part of my thigh is 18 inches. I hope this can give you an idea of the fit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This product was a lot of fun.  I got this for my girlfriend who is about 5'7-ish and 198 Lbs.  I used the sizing chart, and she fell into the Plus size category, so that's what I bought.  However, I think she could have done just fine with the regular size - after the second use (over a long weekend) I did notice that they tended to come off her thighs kind of easily.That being said, I am totally going to purchase these again, in a different color, and buy the smaller size

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  If you have thick thighs, this product wont sit correctly in order to snap it into the guarder (it will continue to roll back down your leg, annoying!).  It was the super struggle in the bathroom trying to get ready for the evenings ""events"" but I came out sweating and looking like frustrated...needless to say i got it to work but they should consider if you are tall and wide, you thighs might be wider than your calf or knee. Im just saying...im 5'9"" and 200 lbs

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm not overweight but do have thick legs. Regular fit thigh highs give me the muffin top apperace that is unflattering. These did not! Love them!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love these but I may send them back. I will never understand why stockings have to be wrapped around a piece of cardboard.  Inevitably, that stocking gets stretched out and does not always go back to its regular shape (I know I know people need to see them). Which is the case here. They still look good on but since its fishnet, one of the little holes was on the corner of the cardboard. So, that hole is a little bigger than the rest. Which I doubt would be fixed by sending these back and ordering another pair. How many companies make stockings with the seam up the back? Not many. I have looked. It's not hugely noticeable. So, I still gave them 4 stars. I dont see anything wrong with them besides that. They fit me perfect. I'm 5'7"". 150 lbs.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love these.  They fit fine.  I am a large woman, 225lbs and wear a size 20.  I was worried they might not fit either being too small or too large.  They fit fine. They have a line going up the back and the line stayed in place for most of the evening.  Overall, successful outfit accomplished in part do to these fishnets.  I'd buy again.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm very picky when it comes to stockings, these are perfect in every single way. The nets don't break apart or pinch, the top doesn't slip, roll or squeeze the life out of my thighs and they have a backseam -a real backseam -not one of those slightly darker thread kind!I'm 5'4'' and 130lbs so these sit high on me, but I like that. Thus far, they haven't stretched too much and are holding up very nicely. I did manage to stretch the top band a little after sitting for a while with my legs folded but it sorted out with a wash. Love these!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  El pedido me llego rapido (tengo Amazon Premium).Son tal como aparecen en la foto! En la parte de atr√°s hay una costura trasera, que estiliza la pierna.La calidad es buena y seguramente volver√© a comprar.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love these so much.  There honestly so cute. The lace part at the top has this band so they dont stretch like crazy but other than that there adorable.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I have worn these 3 times and they are still in perfect condition. I would buy again for that fact alone lol

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Should have known better, one size only applies to a select group. The tops wouldn‚Äôt fit my thick thighs. Bummer

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  They are quite durable and have not ripped. Also nice and long for a tall person.

  Avidlove, is the BEST lingerie' on Amazon or in any department store! It's GREAT quality, looks FANTASTIC on, colors are ALWAYS TRUE to what is shown and ACTUALLY FITS!  It's never to small.  I am 5' 6"" / 165lb to 180lb depending on the time of the yearüôÑüòâ.  I wear USA sizes large & extra large or a 14-16 depending who makes the garment.  I purchase from Avidlove an XL-XXL and usually find that l could have gotten a size smaller.  Like a regular large would work fine. However, due to weight fluctuations and sometimes a little naughty play, I want the extra wiggle roomüòâ! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It was everything for the birthday boy. He enjoyed it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  While you never expect it to look like it does in the picture,  I think this was still a little off the mark.  The fabric is soft and stretchy, granted,  though i think it actually hinders the look of the outfit.  While it works in a pinch (  needed something next day for bf birthday ) the closure is a draw string which doesn't want to cooperate.  I was difficult to get it tight without the string getting out of waack.  The lace of the neckline wanted to keep falling inside the robe which was frustrating as well.  There's nothing inherently wrong with the piece,  but if you have time,  I would look at other offerings first.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'5, 38DD, and a size 14 jeans. The XL fit perfectly. I probably could've fit the Large, but I prefer some wiggle room over tightness.The quality is great for the price. It's not high end, but it's not cheap either. Color was almost identical to the picture. Beautiful set.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The purple is such a beautiful, flattering color!  I love it!  I am 5 ft. 4 and weight 120.  The small fits perfect!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love love love this! I was skeptical as always buying off Amazon because usually when I get lingerie it ends up being scratchy, horribily made and sized. However, I missed going out to stores with a sick son. This piece was a fantastic choice. It fit great (has a soft draw string so can go as tight or loose as you want),  laid lovely on the ladies, and felt so soft. I was very impressed and so was my husband!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 135 pounds and wear 34DD in bras. I bought a large and the top fits great but the thong is a bit too big. They definitely need an option to pick the size on the thong too.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This set is very pretty! The material is soft and glamorous. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 36DD, and dress size 10 so I ordered the a XL after reading reviews. It fits well although if my chest was any bigger the top wouldn‚Äôt cover the girls! The bottom is a little wonky/oversized but I am picky about bottoms in general.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The item is absolutely gorgeous. I love it. Unfortunately there sizing is terrible. I am normally a 2X. Bought a 4X. Does not fit. Very disappointed.If you want to purchase, make sure you measure yourself first.

  I received tons of compliments on this bodysuit. its very comfortable and not scratchy like most lace. The only downside is that my boobs didn't fit because i am a C cup, but that's pretty common for me when it comes to purchasing plus size or larger size clothing. I typically wear a Large or XL, 210 lbs and i purchased an XL.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was looking for something to spice up bedroom life and was looking for something sexy. Stumbled on to this and bought the red one. Sooo happy that I bought this. Fits just right, and is transparent at the right places! ;)P.S. there's a button at the crotch, so its easy access for the couple during play time.All in all, highly recommend it. You will thank me later that you listened.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is gorgeous! It actually has some give in the material but it‚Äôs not super tight like spanx either. The love detail is really pretty and it looks great on. The crotch snaps so you don‚Äôt have to climb in and out to use the restroom and the cut is very flattering. I didn‚Äôt notice any issues with the lace, it seems a little less fragile than traditional lace, more of a spandex. This is a nice way to feel sexy under a dress or for after hours.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Sexy and stylish bodysuit.  The top is stretchy soft lace. It has cap sleeves and a deep cut V front. The back it completely lace. The bottom is cottony. It has a snap crotch closure. Fits well.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Gorgeous! Exactly as described and more! Lace is super soft and fit like a glove. I bought this to wear with high waisted jeans and heels.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My husband doesn't like when I wear pajamas to bed. But I feel too self-conscious to sleep with nothing. I ordered this as a sexy option. He loves it. It's comfortable and sexy for any body type. I am curvy. Approx measurements: 36DD, with a 35 inch waist and 50 inch hips and the large fit well. The lace is not itchy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this body suit. I ordered an XL but it was way too big, the next time I'll order the L. The material is thin and breathable, making it really comfortable. It is very high cut in the panty area and deep cut in the top. Beautiful and super feminine and delicate.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This item runs a tad bit large but because i wear a 44ddd it is perfect because it didnt make me feel like a sardine

  Edit, two years later!This lingerie is still fantastic! It's lasted well, without any of the lace falling apart or becoming scratchy. It's stood the test of several costumes, as well as getting rave reviews in my love life. I bought another color about a year ago (red), which was a great vibrant color, exactly as pictured, and felt and fit the same as the first one. I may just buy another color this year!2019 review:Oh my god. This is great. I'm 5'1"" and about 275lbs, which I carry around my lower belly, butt, and thighs. I purchased the 4X. This item is amazing. It fit perfectly. Some things to note in particular:- It's not scratchy. It's very comfortable. Sometimes lace and fishnet material gets scratchy, but this is not just comfortable but borders on soft.- The crotch snaps are barely noticeable. You know they're there, because you saw them or used them to put it on, but you can't feel them when the item is actually on.- The straps are adjustable. This really helped me because I was able to adjust the straps so the top of the teddy actually held my boobs in place (I wear a 42DD).I'm just honestly really overwhelmed. I ordered this item to use for Halloween, and I had my doubts. It didn't have very many reviews, but it was a low price, so I went for it. It came within two days (Prime), fit exactly like I wanted it to, and, the cherry on top, it was a low price. I highly recommend this. Plus size girls gotta stick together, so I made sure to write this review right after trying it on.

I‚Äôve gained 10-15 lbs recently and carry that weight in my belly and chest so I wanted something to cover that.  I have a short torso and this fits great lengthwise so I‚Äôm not sure if it would be great for someone that‚Äôs taller, but there are adjustable straps to give a little extra room. There is no support in the bust, but with the way it‚Äôs low cut, it still looks great. Also, fits awesome on the butt. It cuts high up and doesn‚Äôt leave anything to the imagination in the back, but with the front covered, that‚Äôs a plus. I‚Äôm surprised at how soft it is too!Only con is that it smells like chemicals. I hand washed it in the sink and it bled badly. I‚Äôd suggest only handwashing for this reason.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 190lbs and I got this in a XL. I LOVEEE this! I felt very confident and sexy when I tried it on and my boyfriend liked it too!! I wanna wear this everyday

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'9 165lbs. 40,35,43 measurements. I ordered the Xl and the fit is amazing. The quality is suprising for the cost. The lace is soft and silky, not itchy like some other lace lingerie I have purchased. The button closures are quality. The color is exactly as advertised. Excellent quality and find for a cheap price!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Loved this body suit! It fit like a glove great quality!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I absolutely love this outfit. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 145 lbs with 36 DDDs at my age I‚Äôm super proud of them üòù. I got a large and it fit good. Little loose on the rear cause all my goods are up top (unfortunately). I paired this with a black mini shirt and strapped heels for a night out.  I threw over a white button up just in case people said anything.  I‚Äôve never felt sexier.  My husband was happy.  Win win

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'3 and 150lbs. Womens size 6/8. I am hippy. The medium is way too tight down below, but I bought this as lingerie so, it serves its purpose. I could never wear it out in day light with an outfit. The V comes way further down below than the photos portray. But I do realize that I may need a large. But again, its fine for me. I would say order a size up. The material and quality is as expected. Thank u!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Really happy with this item! I am 5'6"" and a 42D cup and a size 20 in pants, I wear a 1 or 2 in stores like Torrid for panties, I carry all my weight in my tummy due to diastasis recti. I wish this had just a liiiiiiittle more chest support, but the cleavage angle is flattering anyway. The lace is a nice thickness and I like the strategic panels that offer peekaboo but not totally sheer. I ordered a 4X and I don't think changing size would make a difference; it fit just right in terms of tightness, not uncomfortable but not too loose either. I may buy it in more colors! It came in a frosted plastic zip-top bag.

  Great quality and fast delivery ! Fits perfect to my size !!

  Very soft material, which I thought contained some spandex, but it does not. I am heavy on the top - this night gown would have been GREAT if It contained cups for support - it is too loose on top, letting my breast hand slightly :( I purchased an XLarge, but probably could have gotten away with a Large. But I do not think the Large would have solved the issue with my breast. I have decided not to re-purchase, but to search for a nightgown with spandex so it hugs alittle more on my body.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  FITS AND FEELS AMAZING. Super soft and very comfortable to sleep in.. but beware if you have nipple piercings and your boobs fall out over night, it does get caught.

  This is the softest nightgown! I am a ‚Äúhot sleeper‚Äù and this modal fabric is perfect- feels like you‚Äôre wearing almost nothing! Lace is not itchy at all (something I have found in other similar items), and it washes well too! It is a little more form fitting than I had expected but so comfortable it‚Äôs ok! Would highly recommend!!

  This product is very comfortable, good quality, and true to size.I'm 5'6 and between 145 and150 lbs. I ordered a large because I wanted a roomy fit, which is what I got. A medium would actually fit more appropriately, but I like the extra room.That being said, I ordered 6 in black, and hope to order more, which will probably include some mediums.

  This is probably one of my faves from Avid Love & I probably have about 8 pieces from their company. Size large fits US size 10/12 (38D) perfectly, and it provides just enough support to be a fantastic presentation! I'll definitely be buying more in other colors, and hope they start offering more lingerie with nip-nop holes.

  I secretly ordered this for my wife on her account. Needless to say it was a surprise when she got the package, but it was a better surprise for me to see her in it. This was icing on the cake. I don‚Äôt know much about lingerie, but this piece looks really good.

  I am a size 12 or 14 usa and this size fit me. It isnt very supportive but for someone with a mom belly the underwear covers it and looks sexy. Very bright color and is very comfy.

  I‚Äôm 217 at 5‚Äù3 and got a XL and it‚Äôs a little big actually. But it‚Äôs very sexy ;) I really Like it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I typically wear a L in most things, sometimes a medium shirt will do for some stuff. I ordered a M in this and it was PERFECT! I love it and it has given me a new love for lingerie. This is my first piece I've ever ordered so I can't wait to get more from them!For reference I am 5'4"" and about 165-170 lbs and I ordered a medium and it fit perfect. I wear a size 36 D (a small D I would say since having children they're deflated lol) and i have no complaints about the bra. Some reviews said it didn't have an underwire which wasn't expecting in something like this.. so it definitely met all of my expectations.I didn't read the description and I thought that it came with the stockings too, but it doesn't. It does look good with black stockings if you get the red though.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits really well! My bottom is bigger and my top is smaller and that‚Äôs how the lingerie will fit. So if you have a fairly larger top but it‚Äôll just be sexier lolBought in a size XLMy US Size: bra 38B, bottom is 0X-1X, pant size: 14-16Hope this helped some of y‚Äôall!

  I don‚Äôt wear lingerie ever. This is like the first thing I‚Äôve purchased. I LOVE IT! It hides my belly pooch and makes me feel soooo good about myself. And its such a great price.

  I really love this.  I don‚Äôt even have to give a review, just look at this thing!  It does tear easy though.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm not sure if durable is the proper description, but for as thin as the netting material is, I was surprised it held together so well. It's like a really soft nylon material - like hosiery, but softer - and I was concerned about it tearing easily (as some fishnet style stockings have done for me in the past), but this has a nice, soft feel to it with lots of comfy stretch. Bigger ladies can easily wear this without looking like a strung-up ham or half-busted can of biscuits. The red is really vibrant (bright) and the black is a nice, dark, true black. Very sexy look and feel.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very sexy piece that my husband LOVED! Just an fyi, I am 5'5 about 195lbs so it did ride up a bit but worth it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am a big woman, I am 6ft tall and over 275, this fit me just fine, the material makes it seem like it will roll up on you eventually but some garter clips and thigh highs should fix that. My husband said he loves it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Pretty damn snug. I‚Äôm a size 26 or a torrid size 4 bottom , size 3 top. Struggle to get on initially but the end result was stunning

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  ""Wow this is REALLY hot""-- what she said

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am smaller then the model, but this was a stretch to wear, it didn‚Äôt bust, but it was close, lol! I wear a 12-14

  After reading some reviews I sized up and got a large, I wear size 6-7 sometimes size 8 pants depending on brand and small/medium shirts. The outfit both shirt and skirt fit me as any sz Large clothes would, flowy/not adjusted to body. Not a deal breaker but medium would've been perfect. I cut 3in off the end of the skirt so that I didn't have a piece of velcro sticking up when adjusting it to my waist and made sure the shirt was pulled down under my skirt so that it looked tighter.I am 5'1"" 136lbs  36B C if padded bra, wide shoulders, thick arms. Hope this helps.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I returned this because the size chart measurements don‚Äôt match the costume. The size large runs like a small/medium. Also, for $40 it‚Äôs incredibly cheap. The white top is paper thin and itchy. The skirt is a cheap tear away that closes with a strip of Velcro. For the money, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it. This should be like $15-20.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My breasts are big the shirt was a little tight but FIT well

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered this off faith that the couple of negative reviews were just off chance. Nope, my package came perfect but the bag that held the costume in it was opened and looked like someone ruffled through it. It says that it‚Äôs a 4 piece costume, mine only came with 2, the skirt and the shirt. The skirt fit way to small (i ordered large and it fit like a small) and the material of the shirt was super cheap. Def not worth what it‚Äôs selling for, you‚Äôre better off going to Spirit and getting a 15 dollar costume. Item is being returned asap.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  30 bucks? Not a bad deal for the quality. I am 5 feet 8 inches and 130 pounds. I ordered a medium and it fit pretty good.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Just tried on my costume, and it definitely runs small. I'm 5' 2"" and 145 lbs. and I have a booty. It covers my tush, but just barely. Otherwise the costume is exactly as you'd expect. The shirt fits well, and is form fitting so that's a plus. The skirt is velcro though, so if you're planning for a night out, I would suggest finding a way to reinforce it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Quality wasn't bad. Unfortunately I had a bit of a difficult time with sizing on this one. While my arms fit well in a Large, my torso is definitely more like a Medium. Ended up needing to take in the sides of this in order for it to fit better and look less boxy. The shirt is a button-up. The tie is simply an elastic band that you put under the collar The skirt is VERY short and strapped on with velcro. Overall, it was a fun costume. I'd say give it a try

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Had a back to school party and ordered this costume. Nice sexy look and my husband enjoyed. Fit as expected.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Gorgeous xXx

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very good

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Me qued√≥ muy bien, la camisa se siente de buena calidad, lo que me gust√≥ m√°s es que la falda es de tela gruesa, tal vez el √∫nico pero es que la corbata se pone con una cinta el√°stica as√≠ que si quieres traer la camisa un poco abierta y la corbata floja no se puede.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm a size 10 and based on previous ratings I decided to star up and ordered a large. Even though their size chart says that large fits a size 12-14 it is quite snug on me. I have to wear the skirt around my waist as it won't close around my hips. The quality of the costume otherwise Is good.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  El material es bueno, en cuanto a la talla, cuando tengo duda prefiero algo un poco m√°s grande y luego le agarro un poco si es necesario, en este caso la falda me qued√≥ ligeramente grande como lo esperaba pero la blusa sumamente grande, les recomiendo considerarlo al momento de revisar sus tallas, la blusa tiene pinzas para darle la silueta a la cintura, pero a√∫n as√≠ la sent√≠ bastante grande para la talla que solicit√©. Pero en cuanto a la calidad todo muy bien.

  NOT plus size and the 'adjustable strap' is super cheap. In fact, the 'closure' is just a teeny-tiny plastic hook sewn into the lace and hooks into the loop made by the strap you adjust. There is no actual plastic/metal loop you can connect it to. Also the strap is VERY narrow at less than 1/2 an inch. Size-wise, if you are well under 40"" for a waist you will need the Plus Size. With it open so it was laying flat (not hooked together as if around a waist) I had the belt adjusted to be as long as possible and had someone stretch it as tight as they could. It was almost 40"" in length fro hook clasp to the end of the adjustable 'belt'. And that's with it stretched TIGHT. Not really a plus size belt. On top of that the straps weren't placed properly so that even with it at its smallest setting the 'back straps' will be right in the middle of your hips, not offering any support in the back for your hose.On top of all of this the mesh parts were fraying all over the place. This was just another cheap 'plus size' piece that obviously just a small model 'blown up' by adding more fabric in random places. It wasn't properly adjusted to fit a real plus sized person. They should just remove 'plus size' and make the smaller version 'small' and the so called 'plus size' the regular size.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm a size 14 with a fairly large butt and wide hips.  This garter belt fit perfectly and it was stretchy enough that bathroom trips were pretty easy.  It's easy to strap on, and easy to attach to your hose.It went through a lot of dancing when I wore it and never snapped off my hose.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I needed this for a Halloween costume pretty last minute, and this was the only one I could get in time. I was worried about the ""one-size-fits-all"" aspect, but there's an adjustable strap on the back that makes sizing a breeze. The lace is soft but thin, so I wouldn't expect this to hold up with regular wear. For Halloween or an occasional piece, it was exactly what I needed!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  What can ya say about this stuff from Leg Avenue but WOW. I bought this for a girlfriend and it fit as I expected it to. She liked it, and I loved it! I have made many purchases from the Leg Avenue company in the past, all with good quality and consistent sizing. They are always a great place to start shopping for reasonably priced intimate outfits and items.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5'4"", 130 lbs, athletic physique, and wear these with size small panty hose, but the straps are still too long even when they are adjusted to be as short as possible. The part that goes around my waist is a little big too. But it's really hard to find white lace garter belts that are of good quality. If you are short or have a tiny waist this might be too big.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I needed this to hold up some stockings for a Halloween costume, and this absolutely did the trick. I am about a size 9 pant size and this fit very well, and was easily adjustable for all the places it needed to be. This item would fit someone a size or two smaller AND larger than me. The thong would maybe be small on someone larger than a 9, but the garter will fit fine. As for actual quality, you get what you pay for. As for care, as long as you wash it in a lingerie bag on cold it should hold up fine.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not bad! I bought this for a cosplay I was doing (Steampunk Lady Gambit) and they did okay...my main issue was that it was HUGE...I am not sure if mine was mislabeled or what, but I am a curvy size 4 in jeans, ordered the small, and it slid right off my body. I ended up having to take the sides in several inches for it to stay up.Aside from the sizing, the belt was good for the price!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The package was right on time!! I was a little scared when I first pulled it out because it said plus size! That wasn't the size I ordered BUT after looking at it and trying it on it fit perfectly. I'm putting this in the review because I think the sizing is a little off. I'm only 135lbs and a size 6 waist and this ""plus size"" item fit perfectly!! I bet if I actually got the large I ordered it wouldn't have fit! So all those looking to order, if your around my size this plus size would be just fine! It does come with an adjuster in the back! But if your heavier I'm not sure it would work :( the adjuster only give an extra 1-2 inches so...yea. other than the size, the product is very pretty and looks to be of good quality!!!

  Lo que m√°s le gust√≥ a mi esposa es que lo ganchos son de metal, esto los hace m√°s duraderos y son m√°s sencillos de manipular. La talla que seleccionamos le qued√≥ perfecta, muy recomendable.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Die Qualit√§t in Bezug auf Farbe und Verarbeitung ist nicht zu beanstanden.Allerdings wird der Artikel als plus size angeboten und leider ist er da etwas zu knapp bemessen, da in den Herstellernl√§ndern ein plus size knapper ist als ein europ√§isches plus size. Wenn der Strapsg√ºrtel aber nicht bequem sitzt, wird er auch nicht benutzt. Der Slip f√§llt sogar noch etwas knapper aus.Wir haben noch andere Artikel bestellt und dort fiel das Ganze besser aus. Andere Gr√∂ssenrichtlimien und evtl. auch mehr Elastan sorgen f√ºr einen besseren Sitz..

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits nicely and the quality is better than I expected for what I paid. The color is vibrant. The only downside is the connecting pieces are a touch difficult to attach to stockings. Overall, I'm pleased.

  I bought this for a boudoir shoot I did, and it worked great! I only gave it 4 stars because the bottom is a little awkward, but for $10 you can‚Äôt complain! It looked great in the photos and my boyfriend loved it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is really cute and very flattering especially for a Mom with a fupa who still wants to feel sexy and look it. Save your money on those expensive pieces they all do the same thing. Sexy on a budget

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, 190 lbs, size 14 in pants size. I order a xxl and fits perfectly. I have a loose skin and stretch marks and always feel unattractive with my body. This outfit makes me feel sexy and it makes me looks slimmer. It covers the belly part. Definitely a must buy for girls with a belly.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super cute and sexy! I'm 145lbs, 5'5"" and i got the medium and it fits perfect! Im oretty flat chested so I always am looking for pieces like this that don't have the built in underwrite bra!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought Victoria‚Äôs Secret for $250, and honestly this garment I bought blew those Victoria secret ones out of the water!!! I‚Äôm going to return all the Victoria secret garments I have and buy more from this seller!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was skeptical at first because I've never bought clothes online, but the material is perfect and it fits great. My husband loved it. It is comfortable to wear and the material feels good.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Update:Terrible customer service.My item arrived today on time. It is very beautiful although it arrived with multiple holes in the stitching that holds the top and bottom together. Apparently this is a problem with this product as stated in other reviews.Because of this flaw I rate one star and I do not recommend.A product as personal as this should be quality checked and hassle free in my opinion.This is very disappointing.Pictures attached.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super pleased with this! I‚Äôve had poor luck with ordering lingerie online because I‚Äôm a curvy girl - things are ALWAYS too small no matter how hard I try to measure or read reviews. This item is PERFECT! I love it so much! It‚Äôs incredibly flattering on, soft and comfortable material, and super sexy while not being super ‚Äúslutty.‚Äù For size reference I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô5 and 200lbs and I ordered the XXL. It fits wonderfully - I don‚Äôt like tight lingerie that cuts into my skin and makes unflattering lines or then looks too tight. This hugs my skin just right, doesn‚Äôt cut into it and just sits so nicely everywhere. I will definitely purchase more! Highly recommend!

  I like this teddy but was expecting it to have underwire for support. Nothing mentioned in the description, but the pics did look like underwire cups. Not complaining, just want other buyers to be aware in case they thought the same thing.  Other than that, very pretty and flattering!

  Love this lingerie. I will order another one in a different color. I wear a size 16 and ordered the XXL. Lingerie is soft and comfortable. I wish the crotch would open though.

  Body fit was excellent but the garter straps have plastic clips and they worked once but not again.

  I can't believe how cute this is. I had it in my list for a while and im so glad i finally bought it. It's super flattering and very comfortable. If you have bigger thighs like me the stockings will be on the tighter side but other than that, it's the cutest set i've ever bought!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  the fact that these are too small really sells feeling like a cow. on a more serious note, the bottoms were fraying and stringy and the tights are too thin to stay up. but overall its cute. top is adjustable but bottoms are super small so keep that in mind. got size small, i'm 5'2"" and 130 lbs. if you're my size i'd probably recommend a large

  Loooove this outfit! Fits perfect. I‚Äôm usually a size xs/small. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù 115 pounds.

  Seller contacted me after I complained about not receiving the items. Make sure to contact them if anything messes up your order, they will work with you!Overall it's okay quality for a good price! Lots of fun pieces for a fun little set overall.

  This says  one size fits all one size fits all only work your eight-year-old girl. It‚Äôs ridiculous.I am by no means large I wear a size 8 my boobs are normal literally this thing will only fit an eight-year-old with no boobs

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Wonderful outfit but the tights were much too tight. And I am a fairly thin woman so if you have bigger beautiful thighs maybe go up a size

  I'm an ""I"" cup, so I have a challenging time finding A top That will actually give me some kind of support and look really good on me. The panties help had my ""fluffiness"" . Honestly, I think the design is so well that it would look great on ANY body type. But for those of us that have a hard time finding something to make our body types to look good;( I'm fluffy as well.) This style will not only look good on you;  YOU will look GREAT!!!!! Plus you will feel beautiful!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Looks amazing and fits very well. Not restricting.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm usually to insecure to get things like this but I like this a lot. It's sexy and comfortable. I am 5"" 3' , 215 lbs, 36DDD and I got a 2x. I should have got a size down though.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am a full figured woman, 5'7, 240, full plush e cup and usually wear a 16/18 or 1x comfortably sometimes 2x to accommodate my breats.  This was not scaled appropriately.  The bottoms fit like a 3x and the top feels loose around the band like a 3x while the cups fit like a 1x.  I ordered a 2x just to err on the sude of caution for my bust.  It is nice looking with soft fabric but oddly shaped.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love how soft it is, and for the price it's a good deal. The top's band under the cup isnt as long as in the pictures, Also the bottoms fit okay but big in all the wrong places.worth the price, but  won't fit perfect on all body types.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 6ft tall, top heavy (42F) and this set was perfect. I ordered a 2x. I usually wear an 18/20, but decided to size up some & I'm glad I did. The girls stayed in place when i adjusted them to sit a little higher with the adjustable strap.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So for me I‚Äôm not too heavy 36 c  so the fact that the top is a lot shorter then pic is disappointing!!! I wanted it like the picture but it has held up in the washer and dryer so that‚Äôs good. Just don‚Äôt see myself feeling sexy in it with how short it really is.  Not by it‚Äôs self thank goodness I ordered this to go under something else!! Papa  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 220  and it looks like a bra if that helps that how short the top is on my body

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I got this in a 2xl for a body reference I'm 5'4 , 220lbs, a 42d/DD, and a size 16 in jeans. I have a black thing on for obvious reasons üòÇ, but I love these! The strap tightens for the top which I truly appreciate being bigger chested and the visual reviews on here definitely helped. The only thing I am going to somewhat complain about is the top piece under the bust my belly is a bit more round and bigger where I had my daughter, but it could also just be user error and I have the straps too tight. But for all my BBW'S out there 100% would buy again in all the colors.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I absolutely loved this set.. first time ordering such things online was worried bout the fit..but top n bottom fit perfect..colour details all gorgeous

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Good quality ,was a gift and liked by the recipient. Good value for the price.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this set! The material is stretchy and comfortable. The only bad thing was one on the straps weren't attached but nothing a stitch couldn't fix!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits like a glove! Definitely buy more from this company.

  I was surprised by how much I liked this little chemise. It is super comfortable and incredibly sexy. My husband liked it so much that I bought another one in red. It does run small like the other reviews said. I am 5ft 7 and it is pretty short on me. It falls around the upper thigh region. I wear between a size 14 and 16 in clothing, and am a 36G in a bra. I ordered the XXL and it fit great. Perfect little chemise for the price. Comfy enough to sleep in as well.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was very satisfied with this dress, considering the price. Its longer in the front and back and goes up high on the sides. Its comfy and flattering ! Overall im happy, small was perfect fit

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  it‚Äôs cute it‚Äôs very flowy but it fits. i wanted a more fitted look so i tightened the straps and tied the back i love it :)!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I usually go with a Large in dresses but can end up with a fit that is too loose in the lower regions. I followed the reviews and ordered an XL in this model and it fits nicely. The fabric is stretchy, silky and flattering - a rare and pleasant surprise with garments of this kind, especially ordered by mail. This is my go-to nightgown style, so I will definitely be ordering more of this model, and may even size ‚Äúdown‚Äù since the fabric really seems like it will accommodate a figure that is not cookie-cutter.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought a 2XL to make sure it was long enough and it fits great. The material is a little cheap but it still looks cute and is comfortable.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm typically a women size 4 and juniors size 6.  I'm 5'9"" and 147 lbs and the small fits perfectly.  It's not super tight, but is still fitted.  Great, soft material and seems like good quality especially for the price.  Definitely matches the description.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The fabric and design of this slip are just right, with a soft and silky feel and a loose fit for comfort. Based on other reviewers' comment I ignored the size chart for my dimensions (40 chest, 34 waist, 43 hips) and bought a size larger than usual (XL instead of L), and that gave me the roomy fit I wanted. If you want a snug fit, order your regular size. Overall I recommend these chemise slips for anyone of any gender.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very basic, soft, smooth.  Hubby likes :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super comfy! Great material! I ordered a small which is great for everywhere but My bust. I found the material doesn‚Äôt have much give and my bust felt squished, however it is tolerable and not so much that it‚Äôs uncomfortable. This is not meant for short people.  The curved parts for butt and side slits are almost to my knees.  I am 4‚Äô9‚Äù and would need to get this altered to have the intended look.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits almost perfect. I'm 4'11 and 96lbs. If there was an xsmall, it would have fit perfect, but it fits, I feel beautiful and sexy in it. Arrived quickly.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Dans l'ensemble, la nuisette est sexy et agr√©able a porter. Seul d√©faut qui compromets la qualit√© de beaucoup est le rebord de la nuisette qui semble avoir √©t√© coup√© et cousu par un enfant de 6 ans. Elle vaut moins que 20$.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Tr√®s joli et sexy. Me convient parfaitement. En d√©shabill√©, ce serait encore mieux avec d'autres coloris. Merci d'y penser. Je le recommande quelque soit votre age

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fast shipping. Chose the dark blue in small. I'm on the skinny side so I like it loose. Model is tall so the length will be longer for shorties like me. The straps are adjustable so it's perfect

  I ordered this on a whim, just feeling the urge to upgrade some of my panties. I was a little concerned about the one-size-fits-all sizing, that it might be too big, but it turned out fine. I'm 5'5"", 111 lbs, and usually wear a small or extra-small. Great fit and sexy looking. I wash on delicate and air dry. They're holding up very well.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  LOVE these. Somehow this one size really fits all!? And I love how it fits snug and never gives me a muffin top that hangs over the side bands. These also have a shape to them that looks like a V in the front and its very cute. Will purchase again, wish they weren't so expensive but I can understand why. They're very comfortable too. I always struggle with thong bottoms where the thong part is way too short and gives me a crucial front wedgie. Not a problem with these things.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It doesn‚Äôt ride and the lace is soft.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Ok ,ok, i get it. $20 for panties that sit on your butt??? We are pretty weird, right? But im on a panty kick: searching for the best thong. I usually wear ""bullseye"" panties--Gillian O'Malley? 5 for $20,  most are super comfy, last about 2 years....but i needed more. Something spectacular.  I needed expensive lingerie!!!! I also am on a bralette kick  (yes, i do have a happy boyfriend, thanks, but I buy these for MYSELF!) Cosabella, Hanky Panky, BTempted, etc....i needed some good thongs!!! Ordered the cheapest color of Cosabella Never Say Never Lowrider Cutie, which was a very nice yellowish peachy color, for just under $10. Sooooooo comfy! Fabric is amazingly soft. The combo of fabrics is very well thought out. I needed more. Purchased a Cosabella Racie bralette and the signature Soft Bralette and they are pretty great too. I'll be searching for deals on these panties, cuz even tho they are the pinnacle so far,(haven't received my hanky panky ones yet) I won't be spending $20-24 on one thong. I just cannot rationalize that.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Perfect! The best brand and the best things ever! Great quality as usual.  They are made from quality materials that fast.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love these panties. I have several colors. They are tighter than Hanky Panty. The lady in the lingerie dept at Bloomingdales said Cosabella last longer than Hanky Panky as well. They do feel sturdier than HP. I like both. We'll see which ones hold up longer.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I really wanted to like these. I have other cosabella stretch lace thongs that fit perfectly. These are somewhat large and do not feel like low rise. Overall they are nice quality though and have washed well.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I just love Cosabelle lingerie.  The fit is perfect, the lacy material is so soft and feminine.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  For 1 pair of panties it took 4 weeks for delivery! It was super late. Also small or more like extra extra small! Very unsatisfied with this order.

  The pajamas are very comfortable, I wear it  a lot when I am home. However, I think the strip are a little bit longer, maybe I am too short for it (5'3''). The shorts are a little bit shorter than I imaged, but I guess it is just as shown from the picture. The red color looks so cute. And the silky material make it very comfortable.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am normally a size small or extra small (Gap, Loft, J.Crew, etc.) but had to order a medium for the waist in the bottoms. But the top gapes around the arms (size 38 B up top). It would be nice if you could buy the tops/ bottoms separately. Also, can't put in the dryer. So the material is wrinkly - unless you want to iron (who irons pajamas?) and has issues with static cling. Material is pretty and soft, but 100% polyester.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this satin pajama. I am going to purchase another pair.  I found out about this company through a rebate site. The only thing that might be a little bit of a problem is if they would let you change the size of the top from the bottom.  I mean every female knows what that is like when they go swim suit shopping?.?.  Still it feels great and looks amazing.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Cute little set. The shorts are very short but I assume that is the correct fit :). Very comfy and great for a little romantic getaway.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The Product is poorly made and the shorts were very skimpy and small, like not even covering anything. DO NOT BUY !

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Product seems nice, but the shorts were missing.

  I bought this after some comments said that you could wear them as casual wear. Um yeah, they definitely look like jammy pants to me! They are somewhat shear. I will not be wearing them outside of my home!! I might return them too. $130 for jammy pants that I really do not need?  (I have plenty of my Oscar De La Renta that I LOVE!) They are nice but they will not fill the yoga class or drop the kids off at school tasks that I assumed they would be good for!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  As a 5'7"" woman I would prefer these to be slightly longer pants. They ride higher in the ankles on me than on the petite model shown here. Otherwise perfect swishy pants for long-haul flights, or for mucking about the house. With a nice pair of shoes/boots they can easily dress up for a night out if you're not feeling the waist-restricting jeans look. Can't emphasize enough how comfy these are.n.b. They're made of some kind of material that makes them oddly heavy and stiff just out of the wash -- after hang drying they go back to being pliable & soft.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great color, great price, because it's fantastic quality. I've bought all colors and sizes. The waist can be a little tight, but buy your Nirmal size. Just let it dry almost to dry, then 10 mins. You can sleep in the lavender one's,  or dress up the black one's in high heel boots fir a Saturday night. Casual and collectible.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The most delicious fabric, super comfortable and versatile. They fit the body perfectly, look elegant enough to wear anywhere and yet ideal for exercise or relaxing.  My favorite clothing item.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Excellent product.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Comfortable and well more comfortable... Easy lounge pants.  I'm enjoying them.  Thank you.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Material is super cozy, however the Medium for me resulted too long. For the amount that you pay for this talco pant, I'd expect to be able to wear it as is. That's the only reason why i'm returning it (although, with some regret and sadness).

  These looked great on my girl friend, absolutely great & they fit her great also.  They big problem was that even though she had gotten a pedicure that day,  She wound up having a hole in the toe of the right leg of the great item.  We both loved how she looked in them.  They made her legs cause to be one of the 2 features that were seen first.She loved that & she loved the way that they fit, that she didn't have to hassled with an actual garter belt & didn't have to attach the stockings to the garter belt.It was just getting that hole in her right stocking, the VERY FIRST TIME is the let down of this item.  I'm hoping that this is just a fluke because she has gotten good products from Leg Avenue.So, I would say go ahead & buy them, but be ware of this possibility.  But the Lady is going to look GREAT wearing a pair of these.And they are a good combination of stockings, garter belt & pantyhose.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  OK. The product came very quickly and was just as the photo but I am 6' 1"" tall and it could be a little longer, but it is fine for the price. Quality is also good for the price. I will buy again because of the fast delivery.I tried to post a photo so people could get a better Idea, but Amazon decided not to allow it.

  There was so much wrong with these stockings. Most importantly was the quality. They were a very thin and loose weave. The moment I slipped them on there were little defective snag lines all over them. (see photo)The second biggest problem was the size. They are definitely not one size fits all. I'm 5' 1"" and 125 lbs so I'm used to ""one size fits all"" often being a little big. However, I swam in them. There was no way to make them snug on my legs. They just sort of sagged there. To have the lace on the leg at the proper height, the waist garter went practically up to my chest. My husband laughed hysterically as I modeled them. They were just  incredibly long and baggy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So, I remember when these were 2 for $10, now they are 1 for $10 from just about every seller. That's a bit pricey but overall it's worth not having to mess with a garter belt, putting the little clasps onto the hose, etc.I am TALL, and they fit me great, stay up well, and last about 2-3 wears before they start to run.I would give 5 stars if it werent as expensive.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Kind of disappointed with these. They had a run in them right out of the package.  I was so sad. But I had to wear them regardless.  They are a one size type deal.  I'm 5'2"". The stockings looked fine at first, disregarding the run. But after a short while they started to sag.  Thank goodness for the built in garter. I would have been dancing at the wedding with them at my ankles. LOL  The seam was nice.  Maybe if you're taller, the stockings would be better.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These babies ripped the first time I put them on. If you are a size 14 they will probably work, but not any larger than a size 16. I ordered 2 pairs, and worked the second pair with my hands to loosen them up before putting them on over a pair of sheer pantyhose, and they worked for the night, but they only lasted that one wear, and ran by the end of the night.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Just like the title says, these are VERY flimsy, they're the thinnest pantyhose type item I've ever seen (and I've seen LOTS of stockings, pantyhose, and tights, I used to wear a different - usually outlandish - pair every day when I was younger). They also don't feel very nice, they're not smooth and silky but almost.. rough? (it's kind of hard to explain haha).On the other hand though they were dirt cheap, I had hoped for better since I have stumbled upon some other great items on amazon for ridiculously low prices but I guess not everything can be a winner, and these aren't totally horrible so it could've been worse (and they do look good on, although I used to have a similar pair that looked nicer it's still hard not to look sexy wearing this particular style of stockings)I'd say your decision on these should come down to the price and how much wear you're hoping to get out of them. If you can get them for super cheap and only plan to use them occasionally then go for it, otherwise I'd do a little more searching.Good luck! :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I've had and been using these for a few months now and have noticed NO pilling or stretching or anything. I even wore them at Halloween and with all my walking around and being on my feet, there was no slippage or loosening of the stockings. LOVE these!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Lovely!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So sexy!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These fit to my knee and no further, zero elasticity in the tops of the stocking. I have very short legs and the fact that these did not fit past the knee was really disappointed. Would not recommend if your thighs aren't as shown in photo.

  Got these in size medium didn't want to get them too tight or too loose but I guess I got to go a size up hopefully those fit and they're not that loose

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I have an hourglass figure so the laced up sides are perfect for really showing it off! It fits perfectly. The only issue is that it can be hard to take off or put on without completely unlacing it every time. And the little metal eyelets you put the laces through are flimsy and come off super easily. Other than that it's perfect! It looks super hot and I absolutely love it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It's very sexy, but tying it up takes a little time and isn't perfect. But it's still flattering and my partner loved it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These Nylons are very sexy, nice material but they are way too short so I returned them!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Feet are weird I cut them out

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super cheap. Yuck. Returned.

  Like most women, I quit wearing pantyhose in the early 00s. They‚Äôre flimsy, expensive, and uncomfortable. The pandemic had me feeling a little insecure, so I ordered a pair to wear to a wedding. They immediately sprouted a run, then another, then they tore. Sizing seemed off but I can‚Äôt confirm this since they were unwearable before I even got them all the way on.Leggings are great, tights are fine, but hosiery needs to die.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am not sure what I received is the real thing. I ordered two pairs because I needed them sooner than Hanes could get them to me. Color and appearance were consistent with what I usually get directly from Hanes, and the packaging looked fine, but one pair ran immediately out of the package and the second, despite being clearly marked as reinforced toe on the package, was sheer toe. Sadly I didn‚Äôt realize till I‚Äôd put them on, and I expect they‚Äôll be ruined by the end of the day as well. Disappointing.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I needed some stockings for a wedding any pantyhose I have tried in the past had tiny tiny waists.  I especially wanted the Hanes quality So I spent a lot of time reading size charts on the internet.  I thought I had found the perfect size, Petite Plus, I am 5‚Äù4 and weight 160 which put me right in the middle of that size range.  Alas, the legs were 5‚Äù too long and I couldn‚Äôt even begin to pull them up over my hips.  Why are all XL or Queen pantyhose a size small or medium in the waist?

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These have a control top that will definitely let you know who the boss is! On the plus side, these are probably the softest and most stay in place nylons I've ever worn. On the minus side, they ladder very easily and are extremely delicate. Only got two wears out of this pair before they gave up the ghost, which is dear, given the price.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Chose my size using size chart and had no issues with fit. However, these are incredibly fragile. I had a gaping hole and accompanying run within 3 hours of putting them on for the first time. Complete waste of $10. I've bought hose from the dollar store that last longer. Bought these on a recommendation from a coworker that wore these daily about 15 years ago. Quality seems to have declined. She described them as having been ""bulletproof."" I did not find that to be the case.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These tights have the classic problem for plus size wearers. The legs fit but when you get to your upper leg the waist band/top of the tights are way smaller. Tried to put them on carefully and slowly but immediately put a big run in them right at the top that split down the leg. If you have a disproportionately small butt and waist they might work. Definitely size up.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was starting to put my toe in the nylon and it snagged immediately. I think it was old. The color was not very good. It was described as ""little color"". But seem to have an orange hue.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These were very comfortable tights, they even fit perfectly. Which is why it's so sad that after two uses a run appeared with a minor snag. I wish they were more durable though, because they really were comfortable tights. If you are one of the rare women who can pull these suckers up without snagging, these would be perfect!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I asked my wife how they were, she said they fit fine and have worn well....with that being said, she doesn't wear hose all that often.  Wished she wore them more tho ;)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Provide great support of the belly area. Very soft, great quality. They last for a very long time. Great product.

  I love the color and the fabric but it fits awkwardly on me.  I feel as if it is a little too big.  Even if I tighten up the straps but I‚Äôm sure the proper size would fit well. I love the robe and dress combo.  Perfect for an evening in.

  ¬†Listen to me: you NEED THIS! Whether it be your honeymoon, a dress up night with your partner, or those of us that just want to feel like a princess 24:7, THIS IS PERFECT! I legitimately feel like I‚Äôm in a movie wearing this little number. Soft, flattering, silky and fun!! It‚Äôs almost TOO PRETTY to sleep in. But what can I say? I want to look good even in bed!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is a nice pajama set! I washed the set right away and the items held up nicely! The material is really silky and soft. I like that the dress has ADJUSTABLE straps, which helps keep them in place. The nightgown has a cowl neck which is sexy without being too low cut. The nightgown is a nice length and has a flattering fit which doesn't cling but isn't too loose either. The robe has interior and exterior ties so it has a flattering look, while holding the robe securely in place. I like the length of the sleeves hitting me below the elbow. Also, the exterior tie to the robe is sewn on to the back which is nice that it doesn't fall off or need to be relooped each time you wear your robe. This is a great set, I recommend it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I have been looking for a robe set like this for a while and came across this Ekouaer Women's Satin Robe Set Sexy Nightgown with Robes Silk Pajama Set. This pajama set is so comfortable, has adjustable straps and is very sexy. The world has a tie on the inside to keep it close and the sash is sound to the world so you won‚Äôt lose it when tying it. I love the cowbell collar and fits just above my knee. You could almost wear the slip as a dress in the summer. I would recommend this robe silk pajama set.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fit and color as advertised.  Thank You

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I usually don't have the highest expectations from lingerie or satin gowns from Amazon (bad previous experiences) so of course my expectations were low when ordering this.  Let me tell you I was pleasantly surprised. It's not the highest quality satin but it's soo soft and comfortable. The fabric is so soft, smooth, and light on the skin and I absolutely love it.I wear a 36H bra and worth my bust measurement being my largest measurement, I ordered this set in XL. Although the cowl neckline isn't as prominent on me, it still fits beautifully. It gives a classy sort of sexy.But one for yourself, your wife, girlfriend, sister, or friend. I think it's flattering on any body type.

  Superrr sexy! üòçSo hey fellow reader, Me & my husband have a VERY active (& healthy) sexlife. We like to keep things spicy in the bedroom so we‚Äôll use toys or do some deep role playing every few months. This particular time, I wanted to be a sexy college professor (I know, corny af but carry on) soo I ordered this set in purple. I also purchased a long dark wig on and some fake glasses off Amazon too. I even pulled out some of my old college books ü§£ü§£ I went alllll out. Soo I got dressed & did my makeup.. the wholeee time I was trying to figure out my lines I was going to say! Cause I want to stay in character and be sexy.. & not look crazy..don‚Äôt want to kill the mood, of course. Mind you, ALL of this is going on while he‚Äôs just in the next room so I‚Äôm trying to hurry up so he doesn‚Äôt walk in and kill the surprise. Thankfully, he didn‚Äôt! So when I was ready I called him to the room and when he walked in.. his jaw DROPPED! I had on a matching thong & bra set underneath the costume  with a garter belt & stockings/fishnets! Listennnn üî• he was NOT ready for all this! He instantly caught on and started playing along and a few minutes after some role playing.. well, you know üôÉ it went downnn, like the volume when the police gets behind your car. Long story short ladies, BUY IT! Plan out a sexy night for you and your partner. It‚Äôll be a night you‚Äôll never forget! Okay I‚Äôm gone ‚úåüèº

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'5, 235 pounds, size 42 DDD/FLet's just say I wanted to buy all the colors but settled with just getting one in purple as well just now.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Perfect in every single  way ( ordered small)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bought this for my girlfriend.  Fit perfect.  Looks great.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  On poinnnnttt I love it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Okay so let me begin by saying this product went beyod my expectations. I was expecting something not, and not only did I recieve that but its also very well made. The quality of the skirt is thick and the top adjust nicely in all the right places. I'm 5'2, 168lbs ( damn Rona made me gain a few lbs.) And I'm a size 36DD. For the most part I'm very self concious, but this made me feel so sexy. I can't wait to get pretty and dress up for my man! He's gonna love this.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This was way better quality than I expected and looked so good. The band on the skirt is pretty relaxed so definitely make sure you're ordering your size. I'm 5'3 145 lbs and a C-cup  and I ordered a Large and it's seriously perfect.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I personally loved it, the bottoms made me kinda want a larger size only because I wish it was a little longer but its still super cute and fits perfectly.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very sexy outfit. True to size. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and 200 pounds. I‚Äôm muscular and in shape. So I purchased a large and it fits perfectly.  Looks good with white stocking and a pair of black  heels.  Thanks Amazon :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  For that little money you can get a lot of fun out of it, first time my sexy wife wear it for me, we needed no fourplay just go for it and my wife had actually fun to wear it for me,

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The quality is very nice. I love that the skirt has an elastic. My husband loved it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  We appreciated the quality,  and the fit was good as long ad we ordered 2 sizes bigger then usual

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The shoulders are strange. May not be good for someone with larger breasts as the seam for the shoulder is at the top of my breast

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  A very cute and sexy skirt with a ton of potential, but it wouldn't even cover 1/2 of my wife's bottom even when she was standing straight.  She wanted super short, and is not shy, but there is just no way anyone could ever wear this except maybe over a bikini, which defeats the ""flirt"" purpose.  5'2""  with full hips, so got a size Large: Front length hits 1.5"" below crotch (okay), but the back would need another 4 inches just to reach down to a point that a full 1.5"" of cheek would show.  Unfortunately, we had to return it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  my sister should not be allowed to wear this

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Actually an impressive skirt, nice material. Other than a comment saying 'skirt fits as regular size' I didn't see a size chart per se, but i used my/the standard (US) size(s)... & its two thumbs up Perfect!!

  I love this so much I bought another color. It‚Äôs so nice to wear silk to bed. It doesn‚Äôt bunch up all night or twist around like a cotton tshirt would. Very flattering for various body types. I am a bit chunky with a gut thick thighs and big ole backside. I typically wear xl but ordered 2 xl to be safe and it fit perfectly. A bit stretchy too. I don‚Äôt recommend wearing panties with this or you will see the lines unless ur wearing a thong. Straps on the top are adjustable too. I personally hand washed mine bc I‚Äôm afraid it will ruin in the washer but it does say u can put them in the washer. I just like it so much I didn‚Äôt want it to get messed up lol!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I run really hot, and especially in the summer cannot stand any sort of suffocating pajamas. These are perfect for me, and really sexy too! Im 5'1, 153lbs and ordered a medium which fit perfectly. The bottoms do have a stretch waistband but fit with extra fabric on me. The top hangs nicely, and i like the adjustable straps on the back. This set is nice and cool for sleep, and the fabric breathes well. There were no loose threads or wonky stitching. Washing was easy, just threw it in with delicates and hung it to dry and had no issues.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love these pjs. A girlfriend gifted me a pair for xmas and ive been adding colors to my collection. I‚Äôm obsessed with satin pjs and between here and SHEIN my needs are met Everytime. Xl is perfect if you‚Äôre a 12-14.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The bottoms are one size smaller than the top. The xs top fits my 125lb petite frame just fine but the bottoms might as well be underwear. The material is super luxe, silky and delicious. I feel super feminine in it but wish the bottoms were more appropriate to walk around the house in.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This can be considered one of the most beautiful PJ my wife has. I picked wine red color, my wife looks really pretty in them. The back design is cute and the shorts are stylish as well. My wife said the PJ was comfortable, she liked them too.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I have been wanting to get a satin pajamas set for a long time and this met my expectations perfectly. Love the fit and soft feel of the material. Burgundy is very flattering!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very sexy lingerie pajama set.  The wife looks hot wearing them around the house.  But at the same time leaves things for the imagination.  Both my wife and I love them on those special nights.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  No, you don't get to see a picture of my wife wearing this lingerie, but take my word for it, this is well worth the money. It's sexy without being slutty (well, maybe a little slutty), it looks great, feels great, and is easily removed either slowly or in somewhat of a rush. Do yourself (or your husband) a favor and pick one up today. Actually, for the price, get 2, you can never go wrong with more. :-)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The material is very soft and comfy and both pieces are very cute. It's ties in the front between the breasts, which I didn't notice before ordering but it's fine. My only complaint is that it leaves a large empty gap between my breasts that makes my chest look flatter. I'm going to do some sewing to adjust, since I can't simply grow larger breasts to fill in the cups and pull it closer lol. Overall though, very nice

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not the most flattering when you have somewhat of a pooch belly. I purchased this thinking it was kind of a peekaboo belly and instead my whole stomach was exposed. Great material though beautiful color. I ended up gifting it to my sister she loves it it fits her perfectly.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My husband loved this on me, there wasn't a ton of support for your chest but its not like it was on very long. Super cute.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bought of a girlfriend. But didn't have a chance to give it to her. So not sure how they fit. Are look on her. But the price is ok. Maybe I will find a girlfriend to give it to some day.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I purchased a XXL. The color is very nice and vibrant but it‚Äôs definitely not like advertised. When tied shut it still shows my stomach and doesn‚Äôt really hug the girls like advertised. While I can make this piece work for me, I feel like this piece is more for women with perky breast.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This item has lots of pretty colors to choose from.  I have a couple of them.  This item fits well and is very sexy.  Not only is it hot!, it is very comfortable to wear.

  Comfortable fit. I‚Äôm a 30-32DD currently due to nursing ü§±üèΩ. Otherwise I‚Äôm 30-32C. These give great coverage just right for me. Very good material. I was a lil bit worried about that but it turned out really good like the top brands. Size small.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This sports bra is exactly what I was looking for.  Comfort, support, and stylish all in one!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Cute back but it rides up. As a fitness professional, I can't have that happen while teaching. Might be better for a lifting session, rather than a Zumba class.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am obsessed with this sports bra in white. The back is strappy, but has a design that is a little different than others I own and I love it. I have a 30DDD bust, but they are saggy from breastfeeding so a small in this fit me perfectly. It had removable cups, but they are thin so just add a nice layer of padding and a gentle push up. I go running long distance in this and feel super comfortable, but also would be great for any type of sports or lounging in.Definitely recommend this one. I am obsessed!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is the perfect sports bra for catching eyes at the gym. The strappy back and cutouts show enough skin to showcase you, but the bra is supportive and comfortable as well. Huge win!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This sports bra is great.Nice materials, comfortable, and flattering. Recommended.

  Love it perfect for summer, no padding though so you might need stickers or if you want wear a bralette. Comfty material.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super cute top. Loved the color fits like a charm since you can just easyly put in on/offf. Want it in other colors!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love this top. Its sexy and definitely will turn heads. I bought a medium but wish I bought a large since I'm top heavy. Would definitely recommend going a size up so you have arm movement room. And with the tie you can wear it as tight or loose as you want.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Absolutely love it!!  It‚Äôs so perfect and not see through. Perfect for summer vacations! I‚Äôm so excited to wear it out :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super sexy and was great for a night out... material was alil see thru but pasties fixed that issue

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love this top! It's sexy and versatile. You can do whatever you want with the ties! I am 34C and it shows quite a bit of cleavage, so if you want a more modest look, then size up! :)

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  My lady is 5 ‚Äò9 ‚Äú fit with very big doubles D‚Äôs  tits and this top is perfect!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very cute crop top for the summer! I didn‚Äôt have nipple pedals to cover my nips so I can wear the shirt the right way so I wore it a different way instead which looked cute!üå∏ the top has a nice stretch to it. The only ‚Äúdownside‚Äù is that the shirt isn‚Äôt a pale yellow it‚Äôs a nice bright yellow which is 10x better!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  this shirt is soo cute but just remember it is very high and runs up if it‚Äôs tight on you. make sure to check the size guide so it‚Äôs not too tight. i‚Äôm 5‚Äô3, 130 pounds and the small fit kinda tight

  This one size fits all should have read XXXXXL. There is absolutely no way that the measurements of the model and the supposed size range are even close. Take these measurements and almost triple them to get the correct ones!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Wow, talk about sexy. GF surprised me with this and all i can say is this... gentleman, be prepared. This is extremely sexy. My only complaint: the choker is velcro and comes off if you pull too hard. It's mainly for show. Plus the leash is a little flimsey. I would give it 5 stars if it was more durable.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Really great , as seen in photo and hot. BUT, the underwear part was too small. It got on me but, not to be graphic but so you get it, it was camel toe city all night. Buy it if you won't be wearing it long or have a small bottom. It is so cute though, I'd still suffer through it again.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I purchased this and received it rather quickly. (5 stars on shipping).I will say it is a VERY SEXY piece.The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because its not really a OSFM. I am 5'0, weigh around 150 lbs, and this lingerie was so tight on my crotch area.  That was the only downfall. Everything else fit very nice and I'm sure my BF will love it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Cute but hurts the ‚ÄúV‚Äù so much! üòÇ Couldn‚Äôt wait to take it off ASAP! My only favorite was the cute bunny headband. Too bad it was painful for me to wear. Not returning it back, just so wrong to return something I tried on. lol Going to look for something else that would feel more comfortable to wear.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The ears are not as large as pictured, and the tail sits really high, easily correctable with a very minor snip-n-stich, but that isn't a disappointment,  this little number was a gem on my wife,  who said it was comfortable

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Its comfy, that's for sure, but if you have a big chest just avoid this unless you want to do repairs on it. The straps on it broke as my chest is fairly large so it didn't last even three minutes into wearing it. I'm now having to repair it and while I expected this, its still such a shame.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love it so much!!!

  Ok so the thongs are good, they are cotton which is great cause it allows your kitty to breath which is healthy. But the band is so thick, you can tell it's one of those that will twist and bend up after being washed. Then please beware. If your not perfectly thin, these will give you and odd shape, I got them because they are high wasted, but the sides are so cut that my fat just pops out of there. I know I know Tmi but your gonna want this info if your a big girl. Now they never rolled down which is amazing but the band does roll over just a bit. I didnt get multiple colored either as I ordered, some of mine came repeated. That doesnt bother me to much. All in all for the price I mean it's not horrible. But it isnt going to be your favorite thing to wear. Its comfortable though so you could use it to work out or for daily regular. But this isnt something fancy and the quality is amazing. Would I buy again? No. But I don't regret my purchase either.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It is SO tough to find cotton thongs, much less for the larger girl.  I am 5'9"" 235# athletic build.I read the reviews, normally get 2x, bought the xxxl.  These are FINALLY exactly what I was hoping for.  They are high waist, cotton, and comfortable.I bought a different type at the same time, hoping that I may like one of them (Nabtos). They were ok.This is what I was looking for!  They have a Nice WIDE waist band, don't roll down, are NOT tight.  I will be placing another order for these!!!!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These panties are perfect to wear working out or for everyday wear.  I love the fact that they are higher and closer to the navel.  Most thongs these days are bikini style which I find to be uncomfortable.  Plus the higher rise helps to hold my tummy in, so I wear these with skinny jeans or any item that has a tight fit.  There is just enough spandex (5%) that holds you in without being uncomfortable.  Plus the fact that they ate 95% cotton is great since that's another rarity these days.  Cotton keeps you cool and comfortable.  I'm 5'7"" and weigh 130 lbs. and I ordered a  Large (size 7) which is the size I normally wear in a panty.  I can't abide too tight panties. It's bad enough that I have to wear a bra everyday....enough binding already.  I'm definitely going to order another pack.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Perfect fit, finally!! I‚Äôm normally a medium but bought these in large due to your other reviews and they are a perfect fit. haven‚Äôt bought them before but took a chance because I hate the low cut low riding panties sold everywhere today and have been hunting for higher rise for years now due to the low rise jeans that were so in style these went out of style and left me looking for the comfort of the higher rise only to keep finding low rise in every store I tried! These also have a little wider crotch area in them so they don‚Äôt ride up like the newer ones so often do. These fit like the 90‚Äôs style so ladies if it‚Äôs what your looking for these are the ones. These come over the hip, wider crotch, higher waist to them, I‚Äôm a size 7 the large is perfect. Thank you so much and get more colors because I will be ordering more!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I LOVE THE FIT. I'm so picky about underwear fit and these are truly great for the cost. One major drawback though is that, in the 12-pack I received, two pairs of underwear had stains on them!!!! One of the two stained pairs also appeared to have been tried on by a previous person because the elastic on the back side was stretched out beyond any of the other pairs. The stains could have occurred in the factory or by a previous buyer, but any stains at all on underwear is a NO GO for me. I'm so disappointed in the condition it was shipped and wish I could have received a full 12-pack because these really do fit well.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It's taken a long time to finally find excellent, thicker cotton thongs with a higher-waisted, thick elastic covered band on top and real elastic covered seams for the rest of the garment. At the time of purchase I did not have much of a choice but to purchase the variety color pack but PLEASE DO NOT STOP PRODUCING THIS STYLE!! LOVe it and after many, many years of cheaper quality and not-so inexpensive thin cotton ""seamless""-feel-like-I'm-always-having-to-pull-out-or-readjust-too-short-in-the-rise thongs (phew!) I have finally found a comfortable fitting thong on this very curvy but proportioned short frame and I didn't have to readjust not once! Thank You Best Brand Basics!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I really like them.  Run a bit small.  Soft, comfortable and wash up nice.  I ordered a second pack.  I usually would use a medium or size 6...but I went for large per the other reviews....I could have maybe even used an extra large but like it a bit tighter to keep that tummy from sticking out.  I am 5'10"" and 170...great price and product for me.  I didn't find them thin at all and thought for the price it's a good deal...that is why I reordered them in different colors. Also liked that they covered a bit more area and were higher as I am in my 50's but still rocking the sexy lol!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  really like these!! they‚Äôre as comfy as a thong can be, and verryyy flattering. nice thick fabric. i have been wearing them for a little less than 2 months and they‚Äôre holding up. i‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 155 lb, and at the right angle they make me look almost flat-stomached! i just realllllyyy wish i could find some with the same general cut in the front, but not a thong though. *wink wink* @sexy basics, i would totally buy those.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  UPDATE: they go really stretchy after a few washes and lose their shape a bit as the bottom bit stretches so they end up looking wayyyy too longI'm a UK 12/14 for underwear so I bought the XL (as the reviews on the US site said they come up small) and they fit perfectly! They are so comfortable and they are really good quality material. They are high waist which is really nice and I will be ordering more!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Good quality and comfortable. Size is smaller than expected and had already bought a size up from my usual.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm a U.K. 8-10 I normally wear a S-M in everything. I bought a large and they are still tight and show a panty line and definitely not high waisted. Huge fail.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very pleased with these, fit as expected, no VPL and no roll down. Good basic thongs.

  VERY flattering. I didn't expect much because of the price but im satisfied!!  Probably one of my favorites. When you pull it out the packaging , you think there is no way im fitting into this! Yaas girl you will & you'll look hot!If you want something sexy and super affordable, this is it! I recommend purchasing multiple colors because you'll want to anyways once you get it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Ladies let me tell you. I love how this outfit looked on me. It‚Äôs extremely soft and comfortable. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 195lbs. 38 DDD with hips and a big behind. So if you are top or bottom heavy like me you will not be disappointed. This fit me perfectly and It has  a lot of stretch to it. I felt so very sexy in this and my husband loved it more than I did üòâ

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great item, true white and glows neon blueish under blacklight, just as I hoped!!!I am 5'9"", small chest and waist but thick booty and it fits like a hoochie dress lol. Short, but not t-shirt short. I really like it, it has a lot of stretch, so there isn't any squeezing out of the side holes. I am lean and thin, but I've had kids, so my skin is t as firm. I get self conscious about any sort of hang over, but it stretches enough to fit probably anyone

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This product is great, the reason I gave it 4 stars is because I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 175 lbs size 14 bra size 38f and I think if you were bigger then me this would rip. Honestly I‚Äôm afraid this will probably only get one use lol. But it will be a good one. It‚Äôs a great price! Super cute, hides everything that I‚Äôm not comfortable with and my boobs look amazing. I feel so sexy in it. I would recommend.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought this for my wife and it didn't disappoint!  When she first pulled it out she laughed at me.  She said it looked like a long sock that someone had cut pieces out of.  She put it on and I couldn't take my eyes off her.  She said it was super stretchy and was easy to get on.  It fit like a glove.  I wish she could wear it all the time!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I don't know if there is a right way or wrong way to wear this, but I tried wearing it two different ways. Both ways were comfortable, but I also didn't realize where the arm bands went at first (I originally thought they were garters or stockings). Once the piece has been worn for a while - especially the arm bands - it doesn't sit as well as it does when first putting it on. The piece stretches and doesn't return to the original form until after washing it. I did get compliments on the piece, though, and I plan to wear it again. Make sure to hang it dry!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Cheap material

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Product does not line up with all bodies.  The material was super cheap but it stretched out to my body.  It was an incredible stretch and it looked sexy but it is easy to rip or tear.

  I love this piece! And the quality is great.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This pretty little piece made my husbands jaw drop. I sent him pics while he was at work and he wanted to rush home lol I ordered the pink one and sadly never received it. I am 5'10 205lbs 38DD and ordered the 1x/2x....I felt like it was a little short (I'm mostly torso though) so I opted for the pink in 3x/4x which obviously I can't speak on since UPS delivered it who knows where. The lace does stretch a little. All in all, it's worth the money I paid and I'd re-order in other colors.*UPDATE*The pink 3x/4x was too big on the lower half (waist down) of my body. It may work for someone with larger hip/butt/upper thigh area. Gonna stick with the 1x/2x since my husband won't mind at all if it's too short ;p

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and 240lbs and I love it. So does my husband. There‚Äôs no support for larger busts, or for any at all, but it is what it is. Soft and the color was as ordered.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is very sexy. Panties where a bit small

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Seldom do I find a lingerie that I find classy yet sexy and this definitely is both.  The lace wasn't super thick but wasn't thin and cheesy either.  I am VERY particular on my lace.  It didn't tangle easily and and looked identical to the stop photo (which is a hit or miss too when ordering online for me).  I felt sexy and beautiful in this.  Definitely would be amazing for an anniversary or your wedding day.  I liked it that much!  For reference my measurements are 34B/26/37 and the small/medium fit me perfect.  Girls if you have big boobs this thing will look even more crazy hot!  Arms were nice and long too...love that .....great purchase!  Husband was pleased.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am 5'10 and 280lbs. I ordered the 3/4x and it fit like a glove. The material is stretchy so it will work for most shapes. The only downside is the matching thong looks like it is a ""one size fits all"" which definitely is not the case and is a common problem with plus size lingerie

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  LOVE THIS! It's like magic lingerie for the non-twig women! Very sexy and revealing while still being forgiving to your less-favored body imperfections. I bought it to wear to my first sexy club. I wore it over another much-more revealing black lingerie top over light pink underwear set. Black garters, high heels. My man about fell out of his seat and almost wanted to skip the club haha! I got MANY compliments that evening by men AND women, something I'm not normally used to so I felt very very sexy while staying so super comfortable that I could dance and mingle without feeling like I'm going to fall out of my lingerie (large-chested girls, you know what I'm talking about!)10 stars! I will be buying more of these in other colors!SIZING: You really don't have to worry so much about this as other lingerie, but I know I still went through a bazillion reviews for comparison so I'm 5'9"" 185lbs. Super wide hips (about a size 13 jeans) with big booty (not bragging,I mean it's hard to find good lingerie coverage with proper fit). Bra is 40DD.Hope this helps! Get it girl! You look fabulous!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I feel amazing in this. I could pop some underwear on and wear this out. It‚Äôs beautiful for the price. I‚Äôve never felt so amazing wearing something like this.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Wifey has an overhanging belly from giving birth and even though she's still curvey , most clothing isn't very flattering for a girl larger than UK size 22 ' but this fitted perfect and did the job , we haven't used the thong that comes with it as i prefer s woman in knickers and wifey don't do thongs '. I had fun and thought it was very flattering on her ' so this is great if you have a serious belly or are not the shape of a model '. I bought the largest size and only the cuff's had slack but its stretchy üôÇ

  I bought this little lovely piece of lingerie, a few months ago. However, due to quarantine and being away from home for some time, I‚Äôve had not now worn it two times. It‚Äôs been washed once. And after one single washing, it is in horrible shape. It has spandex ‚Äúthreads‚Äù sticking out, all over the place. If I were to wear it, I‚Äôd look like I needed to shave. It looks awful. And that‚Äôs just one washing and two times wearing it (and let‚Äôs be real, it only gets worn for a short period of time üôÇ). I liked the dress when it arrived, but it‚Äôs now useless to me. So I feel like I‚Äôve literally thrown away money. Shame. üòû

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  (Lingerlove long sleeve all lace mini dress)I‚Äôm a very curvy 5ft 7‚Äù / 26 (54/1.71m) and this fits and feels great.I can wear it off the shoulder or pull it up. it‚Äôs got a nice flattering round neckline.It does immediately ride up though. A lot and all the way.I planned to wear to a sexy party with a thong but it can‚Äôt cope with big curves so it will only ever be an indoor treat.Still a nice sexy outfit that stretches and fits curvy people !

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  i loved this but it it is a little short in the body, i'm 5ft 6 and only skimmed my bum so when you walk it rides up, shame it isn't a little longer but otherwise lovely

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This makes you look sexy as all hell! Post baby so got rolls in all the wrong places, carrying a bit of extra weight and post breastfeeding boobs got me droopy and flat. But this has me looking real good. Super feminine with the lacy floral design I got it in burgundy. Just covers the bum and hugs you all over giving shape and illusion. I bought crotchless black panties from on here to cover my c section scar ;)  and a pkg of those lift pasties for the girls and its gonna be a fun night cause I'm feeling myself in this.

  Very sexy! I love this! It goes perfect with fishnet stockings! I thought it would be small when I seen it but it is very stretchy!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Husband loved it 5' 3 34d 130lb bought a medium material is streatchy.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is gorgeous and came on time, packaged well and it a great price. Very happy! This strechy fabric will fit, feel great and look great on any body type!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This dress fits great, it is so stretchy it would fit anyone!  It is very sparkly and the stones have stayed on even though I have washed it several times.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Originally when this thin piece of nothing arrived I was like WTF... I must‚Äôve looked at the image 100xs like there is no way in hell all my ‚Äúassets‚Äù getting in this. In fact it must‚Äôve sat in the packaging for 3 weeks as I couldn‚Äôt figure it out... oh but baaaaaaby when I finally tried it on, OMGEE.... it‚Äôs sexy as hell and definitely stretches to the MAX.... I‚Äôm BBW and it accentuated everything- the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it‚Äôs super cheap material - BBWs get this oneüëèüèæüëèüèæ Oh you‚Äôre welcomeüòÖ

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm usually not a fan of one size items but this one was perfect. I'm 5'4"" and 215 lbs, wear a women's 16/18, and heavy in the butt and hips and it fit great. It even covers my butt (barely but hey). Obviously there's zero support age for boobs, but my husband won't car about that at all.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Upon opening I was a little worried as it was such a tiny thing, but believe me when I tell you it expands. You could easily get in if you're up to 200 lbs, I'm at 230 and it fit just under the cakes lol.. Pretty flatering, but still shows pretty much all of your sides completely. For me, it still feels better than being fully naked, so still a win. Its cheap enough to try and gift at a bacheloretty party or something if you don't like it..good luck!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  So yes, when you first get this item and remove it from the bag it looks extremely small.... in fact, it looks so small that a baby couldn't even fit it's let through it. HOWEVER, this thing is super stretchy! I am pretty small as it is (5 foot 105 pounds) this literally fit me perfectly and it's soooo sexy! I saw the other comments from other women who weigh a bit more than I do and even they had no complaints on this gorgeous lingerie so I knew I had to take a chance - for the price it is 100% worth it! Your boyfriend or husband/wife will completely admire this!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love this. Very stretchy and gorgeous colour. Fitted my curves like a second skin but comfortable. I wear with a blue g string underneath - looks awesome I have been told. Rides up when walking but is not really attire for a walk in the country or Tesco‚Äôs.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Partner loved this looks great on

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Nice but I ordered the hot pink colour and it was actually baby pink üòí I wasn't happy as I ordered it specifically for the colour but the bf loved it so hey ho üòÖ

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  They sent the wrong colour it was pink still nice but would of preferred the red

  I‚Äôve ordered plenty of lingerie from Amazon and I‚Äôve never had a problem. But this one was outright horrible. It ripped while I was attaching my garter belt to it. And before you ask, no. I don‚Äôt have large thighs. I legit have chicken legs so for this to happen to me, I was shocked.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Y‚Äôall ‚Äúone size‚Äù is one size to big for twigs I cal legs! I mean lemme rephrase I weight in at 130 standing 5‚Äô7 and as soon as I stood up they dropped to the ground like they were praying for forgiveness! You may actually no ... not you may.... you WILL need a garter to hold these saggy puppy‚Äôs up! Like a bra holding your boulders!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great thigh highs, hard finding these for thick thighs but these are perfect. I love the color and quality is great.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Good quality fabric, feels so soft, bright red color. The only thing I dislike was that it keeps falling to your ankle if you wear it by itself.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I have moderately fat thighs but these stockings did not make me flop at all. They are extremely elastic so you can adjust the height anywhere from above the knee to all the way up to your booty. They are also not easily deformed and the color is very vibrant. Love it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  idk why but i just assumed they‚Äôd come w the garter belt thing but apparently not. unfortunately they slide down and i don‚Äôt even wanna have to worry about pulling them up all the time. this was supposed to be for a halloween costume but i might not end up wearing them because of that reason, sucks but they‚Äôre cute i guess?

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Now listen I‚Äôm 4‚Äô11, 114pounds , slim thick girl , I will give the tights 5‚Äô2 and below if  taller they probably won‚Äôt reach your thighs unless you buy the garter  , I love them fit will , would recommend

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Nice product! My only complaint is that their is no gel around the garter to keep the stocking up. I would have to wear a garter belt with these.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Product barley went past the knee 5""10"" -160 lbs I dont think so... TOO SMALL

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  They fall down need stickie inside of it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  It slides off,not flattering at all

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great product

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Looks really nice on. But doesnt stay up. My thighs are thick but still doesnt stay up.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Daaaaaaaaang Gina!!  These are GREAT!  I wanted to spice things up but I've tried garter belts before and tried attaching thigh highs to them... #Fail.  These actually work great!  They don't squeeze and make me look like I have muffin top or bubble over in my thighs like normal thigh highs and garters do.  You still need to take care when putting them on since they are only connected by a thin strip of material on the outside of the thigh.  But they looks SUPER sexy! LOVE!  I would love to see nude colors, too!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is not plus size. I wear a size 8 or 9 in pants and this barely fit. I got it plus for comfort and so it didnt roll and it did just that. Disappointed.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Went into the trash. I received these on the 11th and unfortunately didn't open them until tonight when I was getting ready to go out to dinner (that was my first mistake, second mistake was assuming that due to the known brand they'd be wearable). Two issues. The left leg where the stocking attaches to the lace strap that leads to the belt was sewn twisted in the back, and instead of the two straps being equal distance they were really close together on one side leaving a weird placement/gap, definitely not flattering (and not comfortable to wear). Also there was a run starting at the stitching in the thigh band so even if the stitching wouldn't have been irregular/completely off) they wouldn't have been wearable. I literally won't be purchasing anything Leg Avenue brand again.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Honestly these are pretty crappy. I like the idea of a garter with a regular waistband like tights- but this was not a good execution of that. And the stockings were horrible. They literally have tiny runs in them just from taking them out of the package and putting them on- and I was really gentle with them. I‚Äôve never had stockings this low quality. The stockings are also TINY. I have average built legs and am 5‚Äô6‚Äù and could barely get them up on my thighs. The top gives everyone a muffin top and the garter straps don‚Äôt actually hold the stockings up. Spend a little more and get a decent garter/stocking set.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Cons, garter belt is for a toddler. I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù and weigh 160lb, bottom heavy. Chose queen size as it‚Äôs supposed to fit up to 250lbs, fits me like a overstuffed sausage, I have a 28in waist, and even it my most narrow waist point this is digging into me giving the silhouette of a toothpaste tube squeezed in the middle. Idk about the rest of you all, but I like smooth lines.Pro, the thigh highs fit, love the thick tops, they do not dig into my thighs, just wish I had a flattering belt to hold them up

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  As someone who doesn't usually leave reviews - I'm excited to leave this one.These tights and belt are AMAZING. They fit beautifully and are snug enough not to slip or ""bag up"" around the ankle, but not so tight that they make you bulge out of the top. Straps for connecting the belt to the leggings are adjustable so you literally cannot go wrong here. Reinforced toe is a MAJOR plus and these tights are strong! No rips, runs or pulls.10/10 would recommend.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These are cute, speaking about the sheer option.  However, I‚Äôve only tried these on, and there is a run already near the top of one leg. I don‚Äôt think I snagged it on anything, so I‚Äôm unsure if it arrived that way. Also, imo, these run a little small for being one size. I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô0‚Äù, size 2, and I would consider these a size small or xs/small for its length and for the band stretch. I don‚Äôt like having any bulges, and I think this would cause a fat flap for a larger person. I think the fishnet option would‚Äôve been a better choice.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Really disappointed, the suspender strap broke the first time  I wore it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The ones I received were completely different to the image and had a ladder in them

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The item that came is completely different from what is in the picture looks nothing like the advertisement definitely wont purchase from this seller again.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  These are not as the picture states wanted the fishnet ones but they are sheer.Misleading advertising

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Not very flattering

  My wife loved it and it fit perfectly

  Runs very small and their an XL can‚Äôt fit in it at all smh but they were cheap so Not too disappointing.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'2"" 182lbs,a 40C and I ordered a large which is my usual size.The top was too small. I could get it on but needed help taking it off.When it was on,it squeezed my boobs because it was too tight. The bottoms fit great except was a little snug at the waist which means I had to order up. The lace is a little itchy.All in all,they're a beautiful color and my husband loved it.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Really good gonna order more

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super cute and comfy. If you're too heavy, this will not fit you

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The bottoms looks like conservative 50's swimsuit bottoms and not in a good way. They also don't stretch so they look like you're wearing weird shorts.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The top was cute but the bottoms ended up looking like old lady bloomers. Not cute at all lol

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Order up a size especially if you are bottom heavy like me. I'm 5'7"" 150 lbs. Ordered an xl and it fits ok, handwashed and layed flat to dry. Stitching wasn't great had areas on the legs were stitching was puckered.  Fair quality for the price.

  Absolutely love it. Didn't want to reveal the back just becuz only 1 pair of eyes named Jody are to see. But I promise ladies that its very comfortable and very sexy. This was my best piece of lingerie so far to buy. I'm very happy

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Hate it I tried to return it and it's telling me that item is not returnable. WTF I am mad as hell this thing comes to my belly that's it . It's ridiculous. Will never buy again

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Fits nothing like the pic!! I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù 130lbs, 34B & 37‚Äù hips. I have a bootie but am fairly small otherwise.  This thing fit like a tank time and barely went below my waist! It‚Äôs to bad, I know my husband would have loved it! AND even though it said return eligible when I purchased it is NOT RETURNABLE!!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Like most have mentioned in other reviews, this dress is really short and really tight. I am 5'2"" and 145 lbs. The dress just makes it enough to cover my lady parts. Otherwise for the the price it's super cute on. Beware of sharp metal back and bottom pieces!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this and so did my fiance.  The fit was good and it met my expectations

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Should have read the review. This isn't a piece for everybody type. One size fits not fit all.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  As far as I can recall, this is by far, the worst buy on Amazon. I've been shopping with Amazon since 2005.The g-string sewn incorrectly (unwearable). I guess somebody doesn't know what a real g-string is supposed to look like.This has 2 huge metal on the back (to connect the straps). When I was looking on the photos of the red color version, I couldn't see the back part and I never thought that there were 2 huge metal connectors on the back like that.Just like other reviewers said, this is NOT returnable.Don't let your hard earned $ wasted for this.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Product not as advertised.  Click to return and amazon says it's not eligible for return  ...Yet the listing says it's eligible for return  ...Obviously amazon is no longer to be trusted, and that will be remembered.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  After reading other reviews it probably Matches little bit of each review left by other buyers of that item. I was blind enough to not notice the metal parts at the back, which will be uncomfortable to wear in bed. My own fault, by overall its fair for the price, sexy and nice.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The back has metal parts which I think would be uncomfortable but it was really nice to wear

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Cheap material

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  it's nice from the back but the front it's not like the pic at all seethrow different then the pic. the coulor is too diffirent.

  This is out of my comfort zone for Halloween costume. But im glad I got it. I love it & I went one size up & glad I did im thicker & I have room in tigh area it doesn't cut me.  Only thing is bra cup loner moves around a little more than I like but still sexy. Everyone said stockings were small I just ordered some from shein.  I'm 5'6 213lb

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 270 lbs and 5ft just a little over quarter. I'm carrying 67lbs just alone in the bust area. Which is 57 inches around the bust, waist line 40"" and my hips at 52"". I usually have to get my costumes or even dress custom-made or bigger just to fit the bust.üòë Doing so I went a size up just to be in safe side which was the 5Xüò∂üò±. And that was a big mistake as soon as I put it on even with the straps the whole thing just slid right downüò± I'm hopefully I can shrink it in the washerü§û but I doubt it because of the material that it was made of. If you are a busty woman with a 57in bust i will advise you to get a 3x. I might have just to replace the onesie with a nice black swimsuit so my girls can stay put. ü•∫

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is a very well made products but it dose run small so I recommend buying a size up and in the crotch area it isn't sewed together it's holds together with three little buttons that's the only issue I have with this. Other then that I highly recommend this product.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was skeptical about purchasing my normal size which is a medium and a few reviews said to size up so I got a large. Long story short it was WAY too big and I reordered one in a size small. It fit PERFECTLY! If youre petite and thinking about purchasing a smaller size, go for it. The bodysuit really contoured my figure which is exactly what I wanted.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The fit was perfect. Got a small (5'7, 110 pounds). The fabric and finishing of the suit itself are very nice. The neck band with the bowtie was very large, you would probably have to have it adjusted. The tights fit well too.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought this for my girlfriend to wear, it fit wonderfully. the only issue is that the stocking didn't fit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Too much oversized

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  First, let me say that over all I LOVE this outfit!!It is super sexy! I read a lot of the comments and tried to be careful about size. I‚Äôm about 5 foot 1‚Ä¶ and I weigh about 125 pounds. I ordered a small and it fit pretty well‚Ä¶ except I am only a 34B bust and the outfit itself wasn‚Äôt flattering for that. I altered it by wearing my strapless awesome push up bra and the bust turned out super. 2nd‚Ä¶ the tail on these outfits, my husband thinks is too small. He‚Äôs a butt guy‚Ä¶ so, I ordered 6 inch white Pom Pom‚Äôs and they look sooooo much cuter!! Lastly‚Ä¶ the colors are off. I first ordered the pink‚Ä¶ thinking it was gonna be a hot pink. It‚Äôs more light pink to mauve. It‚Äôs still very cute but  much lighter than pictured. So, I ordered the purple one, and it‚Äôs a dull purple color‚Ä¶ almost like a purple/burgundy color. So, that was a bit disappointing. But they are still super cute!! I love to wear them! Makes me feel super sexy‚Ä¶ and makes for a super fun date night.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I thought a small would be a well fitted size, boy was I wrong. A usual size 12/14 top I thought it would be neat on me. The whole costume has a extra stretch and sits very baggy, my chest doesn't even know where to sit. I thought a bra underneath would give it a bit of a hold up so I didn't need to use the straps. Nope just can't sit properly and these tie ends do nothing either cause it's so big there is no gap to tie.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Very cute good quality comes with everything you need very happyüíóüëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Bit skeptical when I bought it but was incredibly comfortable and fit surprising well! Very happy with it

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The overall costume feels very well made. However the fishnets didn't really fit with the size I ordered, so I swapped them out. Still a great product.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The corset is a nice material! Will say the bra straps did keep coming off. ( do have to put them on yourself) I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 around 128lbs, and it fits perfect.

  Love it!! Super comfy, soft and well made you will not be disappointed...

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I layered it under a crop top for a Predator costume. It stretches a ton. In-built bra was a tad on the small side, but it stayed in place, just don't expect much coverage if you're bigger chested. It was perfect for layering tho and didn't move around.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I loved this sexy lingerie but I wish it fit better.  Its a one size and I got it on but the straps dug into my shoulders.  For reference in 5'8 38dd and typically wear a 1x or 2x top and size 14-16 jeans.  I could not get this on over my head so I had to stepped into it.  It's very sexy and the color I bought is vibrant pink.  I loved that the top is covered and fit like a sports bra which helped the girls out.  If it came in bigger or plus sizes I would buy one in every color.  I bought something similar from another brand and this one was better fabric and fit and much nicer finishes on the seams.  Worth it for sure

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Worked great! Soft and stretchy! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 150lbs with 36 DD. Hubs thinks it‚Äôs very sexy and so do I. I did wear a bra with it to keep the girls up because there isn‚Äôt any support for busty women.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is very comfortable, soft, form fitting, cute, sensual, sexy, fits perfectly.  I actually slept in it.  I'm 5""6',  125lbs and a 34DD.Love AVIDLove apparel. Have purchased several pieces ....

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This can be shaped to wear as a sexy blouse if you scrunch it up around  your stomach, which looked GREAT with skinny jeans and heels for a night out.  I put a nice choker and bangles with it and it worked. The red was a little too loud for my skin tone to wear as lingerie. So I'm going to order the black for the bedroom and keep the red as my going out top. It has a nice liner around the breast so I didnt have to wear a bra with it. This was a winner!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is really cute and comfortable and you could totally wear it out if you had the guts! The only weird thing about it is that for 'lingerie' having a built in bra is kind of odd. Though I guess it usually comes off pretty quickly anyway! It's really flattering too- it hits a really nice spot on the leg and the dress hugs your body and gives you a nice hourglass shape.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  i am 5 foot and curvy.. I got this in red and I love it.. felt nice on the skin and fit very nicely and hugged my curves in all the right places.. I am also a C in the chest area and I didn't need to wear a bra to keep the girls up.. this outfit kept them in place.. husband will be happy on our anniversary... will get another color but wish they offered a dark blue...

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love this dress so I bought a red and a black.It has been made well and is totally worth it at this price.

  I absolutely love this set and it‚Äôs perfect for the price you pay. Definitely hoping to get myself more from this brand in the future!!

  Only gave 4 stars because it was Missing one garter belt rubber clip to be able to attach it to stockings.

  It runs true to size I‚Äôm a size 12 in jeans and got an XL and it fit great. Super comfortable and stretchy. It was definitely a hit

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Muy bien.! Buena tela y tal como pense

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is by far my favorite lingerie set I found on Amazon. Most of the time sets are pretty hit or mix with a lot of differing reviews which can make it confusing to know what to believe. I'm so so happy with this set. Makes me feel good and confident. It's stretchy so I don't feel like I'm being strangled by the set. It's so flattering. Hope to buy more sets in the future

  I never expect the breast part to fit just right for me on any lingerie I buy, even the ones where you can choose a cup size so I prefer to go with something like this and pair it with a bra. It's really soft and flowy! Of course like any of these kinds of lingerie you'll need to buy separate panties because they are flimsy. I wear a size L/XL 38G and 14-16 in clothes.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I am about 5‚Äô6 176lbs. 31‚Äù waist and 36/38 C/D. I ordered the XXL. I‚Äôm not sure how the panties fit but they are super cute. I was very hesitant to purchase this item because I had the gastric bypass about 7 years ago. With that being said I usually need good support in the bust area. This lovely ensemble actually holds my busy up fairly well considering there are no cups or underwires. Because of the fit and the tie it worked and I‚Äôm very pleased with that even more so that this was a Vday gift.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and about 175-185 pounds, so I‚Äôve definitely got a tummy. Usually a size large. I was afraid it wouldn‚Äôt fit but didn‚Äôt want to size up to XL in case that was too big. I went with large and it fits just fine :) it came with the bottoms as well but I haven‚Äôt tried those on. Anyways, it‚Äôs really cute & fits well. Everything came packaged neatly in a zip up bag, and in excellent condition. So far I‚Äôm happy with my purchase. We‚Äôll see how it actually holds up. I hope this review helps any girls with similar body types to mine <3

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  First off I just have to say that the quality and material seems high quality! The lace is super soft and comfy. The ribbons are double layered, thick and soft as well. The halter style is perfect for us moms who maybe need a little extra help and support to lift ‚Äòthe girls‚Äô. I‚Äôm  5‚Äô5, 160 lbs, 32 DD and more on the athletic size and the large fit perfect. Was skeptical about the panties fitting but they also did! When I put it on I felt sexy and excited to surprise my hubby on Valentine‚Äôs Day. I‚Äôm basically a little present, bow included üòâ

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I would say don't bother with this if you aren't at least a C cup. While the rest of the chemise is cute, the bust is cut rather large. I bought this for my wife for Valentine's Day. It didn't ruin the evening but I thought other potential buyers should know.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  LOVE this piece. Super cute and sexy. The top fits perfectly but the bottoms are slightly to big. I am 5'1"" about 115 lbs and typically wear an extra small to small bottom, and about a 32D up top. The top fits perfectly but the bottoms are slightly too big. I ordered a small (all they had and can't order two different sizes). I am not too worried about the bottoms being to big because I have another pair that work with the top and there isn't an extra small available. Would buy another. LOVE IT.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  GORGEOUS lingerie! More of a wine color than red but I‚Äôm not mad about it. The panties are a size too big (so if you order a large, expect panties that fit closer to an XL or XXL) If you have a sewing machine like I do, it‚Äôs a super simple fix and you can‚Äôt even tell. If you‚Äôre hand sewing- it‚Äôs a little more obvious when you fix it but it‚Äôs the part that goes between your butt cheeks... so it‚Äôs not really gunna be seen lol -Aila

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  The fabric is stretchable so it would fit into the size even with large boobs. The straps are large enough to tie a knot behind the back of neck. The fabric at the frills is not swoven, I am afraid that after 2-3 wash it would tear down the threads out. Also, I didn't like the quality of the fabric used except for satin. The color almost matches the picture shown.

  This outfit is cute, but really really didn‚Äôt fit. I‚Äôm a med/large, I got an XL thinking I should go up a size bc of my boobs. Well the top didn‚Äôt exactly fit or at least not well. The bottoms were way to small for my bubble butt. The top of my butt was hanging out & they were snug. So my suggestion is this is only for small girls. Not girls with big boobs n a big butt. Sorry ladies. I feel your pain.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I liked it and it is cute. I ordered a size bigger than I normally wear and it was still too small.  If you actually want to wear it I suggest ordering 2 sizes bigger than you actually need.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I ordered an XL... I'm a L.  The pants wouldn't even come up my thighs. No stretch, definitely not an XL.... maybe a medium.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I would say the sizes are very small compared to others. I usually wear a large and ordered and X-Large. It wouldn‚Äôt even fit passed my thigh.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Ordered an XL when I‚Äôm normally a large. Bottoms we‚Äôre too small.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I bought it for my wife and she loved it, super comfortable and delicate.  Very good option to surprise your partner

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Too small

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Way to small. Medium was like an extra small

  Edit, two years later!This lingerie is still fantastic! It's lasted well, without any of the lace falling apart or becoming scratchy. It's stood the test of several costumes, as well as getting rave reviews in my love life. I bought another color about a year ago (red), which was a great vibrant color, exactly as pictured, and felt and fit the same as the first one. I may just buy another color this year!2019 review:Oh my god. This is great. I'm 5'1"" and about 275lbs, which I carry around my lower belly, butt, and thighs. I purchased the 4X. This item is amazing. It fit perfectly. Some things to note in particular:- It's not scratchy. It's very comfortable. Sometimes lace and fishnet material gets scratchy, but this is not just comfortable but borders on soft.- The crotch snaps are barely noticeable. You know they're there, because you saw them or used them to put it on, but you can't feel them when the item is actually on.- The straps are adjustable. This really helped me because I was able to adjust the straps so the top of the teddy actually held my boobs in place (I wear a 42DD).I'm just honestly really overwhelmed. I ordered this item to use for Halloween, and I had my doubts. It didn't have very many reviews, but it was a low price, so I went for it. It came within two days (Prime), fit exactly like I wanted it to, and, the cherry on top, it was a low price. I highly recommend this. Plus size girls gotta stick together, so I made sure to write this review right after trying it on.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm very happily surprised at how nice this is for the price! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù currently 140 Lbs & 34D. I‚Äôve gained 10-15 lbs recently and carry that weight in my belly and chest so I wanted something to cover that.  I have a short torso and this fits great lengthwise so I‚Äôm not sure if it would be great for someone that‚Äôs taller, but there are adjustable straps to give a little extra room. There is no support in the bust, but with the way it‚Äôs low cut, it still looks great. Also, fits awesome on the butt. It cuts high up and doesn‚Äôt leave anything to the imagination in the back, but with the front covered, that‚Äôs a plus. I‚Äôm surprised at how soft it is too!Only con is that it smells like chemicals. I hand washed it in the sink and it bled badly. I‚Äôd suggest only handwashing for this reason.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 190lbs and I got this in a XL. I LOVEEE this! I felt very confident and sexy when I tried it on and my boyfriend liked it too!! I wanna wear this everyday

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'9 165lbs. 40,35,43 measurements. I ordered the Xl and the fit is amazing. The quality is suprising for the cost. The lace is soft and silky, not itchy like some other lace lingerie I have purchased. The button closures are quality. The color is exactly as advertised. Excellent quality and find for a cheap price!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Loved this body suit! It fit like a glove great quality!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I absolutely love this outfit. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 145 lbs with 36 DDDs at my age I‚Äôm super proud of them üòù. I got a large and it fit good. Little loose on the rear cause all my goods are up top (unfortunately). I paired this with a black mini shirt and strapped heels for a night out.  I threw over a white button up just in case people said anything.  I‚Äôve never felt sexier.  My husband was happy.  Win win

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5'3 and 150lbs. Womens size 6/8. I am hippy. The medium is way too tight down below, but I bought this as lingerie so, it serves its purpose. I could never wear it out in day light with an outfit. The V comes way further down below than the photos portray. But I do realize that I may need a large. But again, its fine for me. I would say order a size up. The material and quality is as expected. Thank u!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Really happy with this item! I am 5'6"" and a 42D cup and a size 20 in pants, I wear a 1 or 2 in stores like Torrid for panties, I carry all my weight in my tummy due to diastasis recti. I wish this had just a liiiiiiittle more chest support, but the cleavage angle is flattering anyway. The lace is a nice thickness and I like the strategic panels that offer peekaboo but not totally sheer. I ordered a 4X and I don't think changing size would make a difference; it fit just right in terms of tightness, not uncomfortable but not too loose either. I may buy it in more colors! It came in a frosted plastic zip-top bag.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Great quality and fast delivery ! Fits perfect to my size !!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  survived in the drier but should air dry, dress to success in the bedroom ;)

  Fits perfect!!!

  Very soft material, which I thought contained some spandex, but it does not. I am heavy on the top - this night gown would have been GREAT if It contained cups for support - it is too loose on top, letting my breast hand slightly :( I purchased an XLarge, but probably could have gotten away with a Large. But I do not think the Large would have solved the issue with my breast. I have decided not to re-purchase, but to search for a nightgown with spandex so it hugs alittle more on my body.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  FITS AND FEELS AMAZING. Super soft and very comfortable to sleep in.. but beware if you have nipple piercings and your boobs fall out over night, it does get caught.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I'm 5ft 1, 200lb i bout a 2x and it was form fittingso it runs small, i was hoping for a little looser fitlooked really nice, very soft fabric

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This is the softest nightgown! I am a ‚Äúhot sleeper‚Äù and this modal fabric is perfect- feels like you‚Äôre wearing almost nothing! Lace is not itchy at all (something I have found in other similar items), and it washes well too! It is a little more form fitting than I had expected but so comfortable it‚Äôs ok! Would highly recommend!!

  This product is very comfortable, good quality, and true to size.I'm 5'6 and between 145 and150 lbs. I ordered a large because I wanted a roomy fit, which is what I got. A medium would actually fit more appropriately, but I like the extra room.That being said, I ordered 6 in black, and hope to order more, which will probably include some mediums.

  I‚Äôm exactly 5‚Äô2 and 200IB and knew that I didn‚Äôt want a tight fit. I‚Äôm sure I could have fit the 1x but I wanted to play it safe and get the 2x and I‚Äôm glad I did. I like that I can breathe in it and not be afraid it‚Äôs going to rip... there‚Äôs room for improvement on two things.1) The chest trap design is not strong enough to help breasts lift (im a 38dd) they are sagging in this.2) The Back design is not for plus size women with a back roll. The back cut out is very cute, but it will show off your roll under your bra strap if you have one.It‚Äôs also pretty short, but that was expected for lingerie. Overall it‚Äôs very comfy and the design is cute, (the black polka dots are velvet), and it‚Äôs pretty true to size. I‚Äôd buy again from this seller!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I love this little outfit. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù, 225lb, 38C, 42 inch waist, shaped like an hour glass. When I first took it out of the bag, I was like ‚Äúoh this isn‚Äôt going to fit‚Äù and even started return on it. Then I decided to try it on just to be sure it was too small...well wouldn‚Äôt you know...it fit like a glove, even the underwear. I like the fact the underwear are fuller coverage and not some tiny string you get with some outfits. I wore it out to a lingerie hotel party and got a ton of compliments. Definitely a good purchase.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I normally wear a 2x but was scared that it wouldn‚Äôt fit right so I ordered a 3x. It fits true to size so I could have probably gotten the 2x but I just tightened the straps and it fits good. I was surprised at how good it looks on me. I was worried about my stomach not looking right in it but you can hardly see it and the pantries look great with it. I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Super cute! I knew this would flatter my body type as long as it was not so cheaply made that it fit like a kids costume you‚Äôd find at 8pm on October 31st. It‚Äôs obviously cheap but it does the job if you just want something to make you feel sexy every once in a while. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it includes the matching panties!Biggest downside? The STRANGEST odor smacked me in the face when I opened the box, and it kinda lingers in the fabric! It‚Äôs not so overwhelming once you wash it, but the weird chemical/plastic/poison smell legitimately worried me and caused me to think some crazy $&@!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I absolutely love this set! I don't buy lingerie, but I wanted something cute for the new boyfriend. It fits great and it's comfortable. The matching panties are comfortable too. I feel sexy, and of course the boyfriend likes it. Win win.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  First time trying it on two of the straps that go across the chest broke! Amazon nor the seller will let you return it.... had to sew it back together myself. Poor quality, poorly made. Wouldn‚Äôt buy again!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Love it!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  Looooove it! And so did hubby! A wonderful night cap to his 40th birthday. ü•∞

  This is probably one of my faves from Avid Love & I probably have about 8 pieces from their company. Size large fits US size 10/12 (38D) perfectly, and it provides just enough support to be a fantastic presentation! I'll definitely be buying more in other colors, and hope they start offering more lingerie with nip-nop holes.

  I secretly ordered this for my wife on her account. Needless to say it was a surprise when she got the package, but it was a better surprise for me to see her in it. This was icing on the cake. I don‚Äôt know much about lingerie, but this piece looks really good.

  This skirt is the cutest!!! It‚Äôs the perfect length for going out dancing or to a festival. It covers my bum fully, unlike the picture it shows and it fits true to size!! I normally vary between size small and medium, and the small fits perfectly on my hips.The pink color is really fun and playful!! The picture I posted is without any filters to try to show the color accurately. It‚Äôs really pretty!

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  This skirt is made to rest on the lower part of hips and will ride up easily but I still really like it. It's exactly what I was looking for! I'm 5'5"", 140lb with an athletic/slightly curvy shape and the M was the perfect fit.

||||||||||||||||||||||||

  I was so worried about buying something like this online and not having it fit right. I usually wear an XL pants or a size 14 becausei have a huge butt. I ordered the XXL and it was perfect! Not elastic but you can still zip it up and have some room so its not uncomfortable. Quality of the fabric is nice. Must have for a naughty schoolgirl outfit!!

  For reference my pants size is a 30, and I ordered a large. I got the skirt and thought it was really cute. My husband LOVED it. It was a little large, I had to take it in a little. It was long enough to barely not show my booty. But it fit and looked so good. Perfect for an exotic dancer or a little fun role playing. The colors were vibrant. The stitching throughout the skirt was good. It arrived unwrinkled and ready to wear.

  Obviously not made for everyday professional wear. Cute runs a little small. Serves the purpose.

  Had to take it in, runs very big.Great for  bedroom playtime

  I really like this skirt but it was a bit loose. I wear a size 12 and bought a large but I could have definitely gotten away with a medium. The material is fairly soft and it just covers my tush. My boyfriend went nuts for it which was the goal, so overall I'm happy with this purchase. :)
